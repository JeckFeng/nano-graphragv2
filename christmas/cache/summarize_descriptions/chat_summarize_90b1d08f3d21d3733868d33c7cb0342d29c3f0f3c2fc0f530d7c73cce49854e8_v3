Documented through both local resident accounts and hydrological measurements, the event left identifiable flood marks (洪痕) that were later surveyed and recorded at an elevation of 823.59 meters. These physical markers provided critical data for reconstructing the flood’s magnitude and behavior. Scientific assessments of the event confirmed that the peak flow during the 1996 FLOOD reached 376 cubic meters per second (m³/s), indicating a substantial discharge of water through the river system. Additionally, analysis of the river reach during this event revealed a water surface slope of 2.85%, which contributed to the rapid movement and high energy of the floodwaters. The convergence of field observations from local residents in Xiao Zhai village and technical hydrological data underscores the significance of the 1996 FLOOD as a key benchmark event in the region's flood history. This comprehensive understanding, derived from both empirical measurements and community-based evidence, highlights the importance of integrating multiple sources of information in flood risk assessment and historical reconstruction. The 1996 FLOOD remains a critical reference point for understanding extreme hydrological events in the watershed and for informing future flood management and mitigation strategies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
