Wengwei Group functions as a constituent hamlet and administrative sub-division within the broader territorial and social framework of Guyang Village. As a localized community unit, it plays a role in the village’s overall demographic and geographic structure. Field surveys have been conducted in Wengwei Group, during which photographic documentation was carried out to record environmental, architectural, or socio-economic conditions. These surveys underscore the area’s significance as a site of research or developmental assessment within Guyang Village. Together, the relationship between Guyang Village and Wengwei Group reflects a hierarchical settlement pattern common in rural administrative systems, where larger villages are composed of smaller, named groups or hamlets that maintain distinct local identities while remaining under the village’s governance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
