Widely utilized in geospatial and surveying applications, TERRASOLID enables users to import, manage, and analyze large volumes of point cloud data for detailed terrain modeling and feature extraction. The software supports advanced operations such as point cloud classification, filtering, and 3D modeling, allowing users to distinguish between ground points, vegetation, buildings, and other surface features with high precision. \n\nOriginally developed to meet the needs of aerial and mobile laser scanning projects, TERRASOLID integrates seamlessly with data captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) equipped with LiDAR sensors, making it a valuable tool in applications such as topographic mapping, forestry management, urban planning, and infrastructure development. Its capabilities extend beyond basic visualization, offering specialized tools for refining raw point cloud datasets into structured, usable geospatial information. \n\nThe software suite is known for its robust algorithms that automate key processing steps, including ground point detection, vegetation and building classification, and the generation of digital terrain models (DTMs) and digital surface models (DSMs). These features make TERRASOLID particularly effective in environments with complex terrain or dense vegetation cover. Additionally, it supports integration with popular GIS and CAD platforms, enabling smooth workflow transitions from data acquisition to final product delivery.\n\nUsed globally by surveyors, engineers, and geospatial analysts, TERRASOLID combines precision, efficiency, and scalability in handling large-scale LiDAR datasets. Its multilingual support, including Chinese-language interfaces and documentation, reflects its international adoption and usability in diverse technical environments. The Chinese description highlights its role as a specialized laser point cloud processing tool, emphasizing its functionality in data classification, filtering, and modeling analysis—capabilities that align with the English descriptions focused on drone-captured data and terrain analysis.\n\nIn summary, TERRASOLID is a comprehensive, industry-standard software suite for processing and analyzing LiDAR point cloud data, especially from drone-based acquisition systems. It provides advanced tools for classification, filtering, and 3D modeling, serving a wide range of geospatial applications with high accuracy and efficiency.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 457, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 672, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
