Situated in the Chonganjiang 001 watershed, Xingshan Street plays a significant role in regional flood prevention and water resource management. The area has been identified as hosting seven flood prevention targets, which include five historically recognized flash flood hazard zones and two newly identified high-risk areas, reflecting ongoing efforts to assess and mitigate hydrological risks in the region.\n\nIn addition to its role in disaster risk management, Xingshan Street is the site of the Xiniutan Reservoir construction project, a critical infrastructure initiative designed to supply drinking water to urban populations. This project underscores the area’s importance in regional water security and development planning. As part of its administrative responsibilities, Xingshan Street oversees both environmental monitoring and public safety measures related to water management, particularly in vulnerable zones prone to flash flooding.\n\nThe subdistrict’s geographic and administrative positioning within the Chonganjiang 001 area integrates it into broader watershed management frameworks, where coordinated efforts are essential for effective flood control and sustainable resource use. Its villages, such as Gesa and Guyang, are central to local community organization and are directly impacted by both environmental hazards and infrastructure development. The presence of multiple hazard zones necessitates continuous monitoring, community preparedness programs, and integration with county-level emergency response systems.\n\nOverall, Xingshan Street functions as a multifaceted administrative unit balancing developmental goals—such as improved urban water supply—with critical environmental protection and disaster risk reduction responsibilities. Its governance structure supports the management of natural resources, flood hazard mitigation, and rural community development within the broader context of Majiang County’s socio-environmental priorities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 668, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
