It is widely used in applications involving UAV-LiDAR (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Light Detection and Ranging) operations, where precise positioning and orientation data are critical for generating high-accuracy 3D spatial models. The software excels at post-processing GNSS and IMU data to determine accurate trajectory solutions, which are essential for georeferencing LiDAR point clouds and other remote sensing data collected during aerial surveys.\n\nBy combining GNSS satellite observations with inertial data from IMUs, Inertial Explorer computes highly accurate position, velocity, and attitude information, even in challenging environments where GNSS signals may be intermittently lost, such as under dense vegetation or in urban canyons. This capability makes it an indispensable tool in high-precision mapping, topographic surveying, forestry, infrastructure monitoring, and environmental modeling.\n\nInertial Explorer supports a wide range of data formats and hardware configurations, allowing seamless integration with various UAV platforms and sensor setups. It enables users to perform rigorous data quality checks, including cycle slip detection, ambiguity resolution, and lever arm calibration, ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the final output. The software is commonly used alongside LiDAR data processing workflows, where the precise trajectory data it generates are directly applied to correct and align point cloud data in space.\n\nOverall, Inertial Explorer serves as a critical component in the geospatial data processing chain, particularly in UAV-LiDAR operations, by providing robust, high-fidelity navigation solutions that enhance the accuracy and reliability of georeferenced outputs. Its integration of GNSS and IMU data processing into a single, comprehensive platform makes it a preferred choice for professionals in surveying, remote sensing, and geomatics engineering.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 399, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 598, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
