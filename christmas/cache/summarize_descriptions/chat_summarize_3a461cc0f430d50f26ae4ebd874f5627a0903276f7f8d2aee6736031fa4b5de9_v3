It is situated in Guyang Village and is also associated with the geographical designation GDZ30, indicating its role as a specific site within hydrological and environmental studies of the region. Historically, TAITANG GROUP was classified as a high-risk or danger zone due to potential flooding from the nearby river, particularly given its location along a tributary of the Ge'dangzhai River. This area, once considered vulnerable to inundation, has undergone reassessment to determine its actual flood risk.\n\nThe group consists of 6 households totaling 25 residents, and has been the subject of detailed flood risk analysis, including evaluations of potential inundation under various flood return periods. Despite its past classification as a high-risk zone, recent assessments have verified that TAITANG GROUP does not face significant flood inundation risk, leading to its reclassification and removal from danger zone status. This updated evaluation reflects improved understanding of local topography and hydrological behavior, ensuring more accurate risk management and community safety planning.\n\nPreviously known as Qingcaitang Group, the area retains historical significance within the local administrative and settlement framework. The name change or alternate designation highlights the evolving nature of local governance and geographic identification in rural Guizhou. As part of ongoing watershed management efforts, TAITANG GROUP remains a point of interest for environmental monitoring and disaster prevention planning, particularly in the context of regional flood resilience initiatives.\n\nIn summary, TAITANG GROUP is a small, residential community in Guyang Village, Xingshan Town, Guizhou Province, located within a studied watershed area along the Ge'dangzhai River system. Once labeled a high-risk flood zone and known as Qingcaitang Group, it has been reassessed and confirmed to be free from significant flood inundation risk. Comprising 6 households and 25 people, the group exemplifies how updated environmental assessments can refine risk categorizations and support safer, more informed rural development in geographically sensitive areas.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 438, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 708, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
