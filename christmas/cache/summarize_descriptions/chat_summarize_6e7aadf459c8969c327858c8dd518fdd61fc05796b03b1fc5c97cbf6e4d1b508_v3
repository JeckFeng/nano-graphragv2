Situated along the banks of the Gudangzhai River, it serves as a site for environmental and hydrological monitoring, with measurements regularly recorded at the designated river section known as GDZ28. This location plays a role not only in local community organization but also in scientific data collection related to water systems in the region. As part of Guyang Village, WENGWEI GROUP is officially recognized in local records with documented population and household counts, reflecting its status as a distinct residential cluster within the larger village structure. The area has been included in field survey activities, during which photographs were taken and observational data recorded to support research or administrative purposes. These surveys highlight the group’s significance in both sociodemographic studies and environmental monitoring efforts. While small in scale, WENGWEI GROUP contributes to broader regional datasets through its inclusion in hydrological assessments and community-level fieldwork. Its geographic position along the Gudangzhai River likely influences local livelihoods and land use patterns, making it a point of interest for integrated rural studies. In summary, WENGWEI GROUP functions as a minor but notable settlement within Guyang Village, serving dual roles in community organization and scientific data collection, particularly in the domains of hydrology and rural survey research.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
