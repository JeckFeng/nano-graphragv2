Identified by the code GDZb4, it is classified as a small settlement or hamlet within the broader topographical and administrative framework of the region. This locality is situated at a hydrologically significant site—the confluence of the Gegendangzai River and the Wengwei River—marking it as a key point in the local river system. Due to its location at this river junction, WENGWEI GROUP is particularly vulnerable to flooding, and as such, it has been designated as a recognized flood hazard area. Specific flood warning indicators have been established for the area to monitor water levels and flow changes, especially during periods of heavy rainfall or seasonal flooding. While some sources associate WENGWEI GROUP with Gubin Village, the more precise and consistent geographical placement identifies it as part of Guyang Village, where the convergence of the two rivers shapes both the physical landscape and the risk profile of the settlement. This discrepancy in village affiliation may stem from administrative overlaps or mapping variations, but the hydrological and topographical data affirm its position within Guyang Village. As a small but strategically located settlement, WENGWEI GROUP plays an important role in local environmental monitoring and disaster preparedness planning. Its identification under the code GDZb4 facilitates integration into regional studies and hazard management systems, ensuring that both its geographical uniqueness and associated risks are formally recognized and addressed. Overall, WENGWEI GROUP is a minor but significant settlement characterized by its location at a river confluence, its designation as a flood-prone zone, and its inclusion in local administrative and environmental monitoring frameworks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 577, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
