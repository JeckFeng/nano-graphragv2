Positioned at a starting distance of 0 meters, GDZ2 functions as a key control section in water surface profile calculations for various flood frequency scenarios, including 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% annual exceedance probabilities. These calculations are essential for flood risk assessment, infrastructure planning, and river management under different design flood conditions.\n\nThe cross-section's thalweg—the lowest point of the riverbed—is recorded at an elevation of 1002.014 meters, providing a baseline for vertical measurements within the river profile. During monitoring, the measured water edge point was recorded at an elevation of 1002.114 meters, indicating the height of the water surface at the riverbank under observed conditions. This 0.1-meter difference between the thalweg and the water edge reflects the localized hydraulic gradient and water depth at the time of measurement, contributing valuable data for modeling flow behavior and inundation extents.\n\nGDZ2’s location at Mangya Village underscores its importance in local flood design and water resource management efforts. The data collected at this section support engineering designs, floodplain mapping, and emergency preparedness strategies tailored to the hydrological characteristics of the Gedangzhai River. By integrating field measurements with frequency-based flood modeling, GDZ2 enables accurate predictions of water surface elevations during extreme hydrological events, thus aiding in the protection of nearby communities and infrastructure.\n\nAs both a control and monitoring section, GDZ2 plays a dual role: ensuring consistency in survey alignment (via the 0 m starting distance) and delivering precise elevation data for scientific and engineering applications. Its standardized reference points allow for repeat measurements and long-term monitoring, enhancing the reliability of hydrological datasets over time.\n\nIn summary, GDZ2 is a strategically positioned cross-section on the Gedangzhai River at Mangya Village, with a documented thalweg elevation of 1002.014 m and a recorded water edge elevation of 1002.114 m. It serves as an essential component in the calculation of water surface profiles across multiple flood frequencies, supporting comprehensive flood risk analysis and water management planning for the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 484, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 726, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
