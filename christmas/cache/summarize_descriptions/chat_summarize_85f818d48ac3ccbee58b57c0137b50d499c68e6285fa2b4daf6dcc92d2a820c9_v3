While the descriptions slightly vary in terminology—referring to Gubin Group as both a \"constituent residential group\" and a \"constituent village group\"—these terms are consistent in indicating that Gubin Group functions as an integral subunit of Guyang Village, likely organized for administrative, social, or municipal purposes. In rural Chinese administrative structures, such groupings often reflect historical settlement patterns, kinship networks, or land-use divisions, and they may serve as units for local governance, resource distribution, or community organization. As part of Guyang Village, Gubin Group falls under the broader jurisdiction and social framework of the village, contributing to its demographic, cultural, and economic composition. The dual designation underscores the group's role not only as a residential cluster of households but also as a recognized village-level subgroup within the rural administrative hierarchy. This structure is common in China’s village governance model, where larger villages are internally divided into smaller groups to facilitate management and community engagement. Therefore, GUBIN GROUP and GUYANG VILLAGE are hierarchically related, with the former being a subdivision of the latter, playing a vital role in the social and administrative fabric of the village.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
