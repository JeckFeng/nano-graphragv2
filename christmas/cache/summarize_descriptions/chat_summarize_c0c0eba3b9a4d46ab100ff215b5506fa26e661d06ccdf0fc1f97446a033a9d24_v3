It plays a significant role in regional infrastructure and environmental planning, particularly in relation to water resource management and land use. A key feature of the subdistrict is the ongoing construction of the Xiunitan Reservoir, a critical project designed to support urban water supply needs. This reservoir development underscores Xingshan Subdistrict’s strategic importance in ensuring sustainable water availability for growing urban populations in the region. In addition to its role in water supply infrastructure, the subdistrict has been actively involved in technical assessments related to flood risk and land utilization. Specifically, it has participated in flood backwater and land use surveys, which are essential for understanding hydrological patterns, mitigating flood hazards, and guiding future development in a manner that balances ecological and urban needs. These assessments contribute to broader county-level planning efforts, ensuring that infrastructure projects like the Xiunitan Reservoir are integrated with environmental safeguards. Together, the construction of the reservoir and the subdistrict’s participation in comprehensive land and flood studies highlight XINGSHAN SUBDISTRICT’s dual function as both a provider of vital public services and a focal point for scientific and administrative planning in Majiang County. Its development trajectory reflects a commitment to modernizing urban infrastructure while maintaining resilience against natural risks, particularly those associated with water management.
