It is situated at the confluence of the Ge Dang Zhai River and the Xibu River, within a watershed drainage area of 77.56 km². The cross-section is characterized by a channel roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052 and a longitudinal gradient (J) of 3.49‰, which are key parameters used in hydraulic modeling and flood flow calculations. At this location, the design flood flow for a 2% annual exceedance probability (corresponding to a 50-year return period) is calculated to be 387 m³/s, making GDZ46 a vital reference point for flood risk assessment and water resource management in the region.\n\nIn addition to its role in hydrological monitoring and engineering design, GDZ46 is geographically associated with Xiazai Village, where historical flood events have had significant local impacts. Floodwaters from the notable 1996 and 2014 flood events reached this area, affecting agricultural land, particularly paddy fields, downstream of the cross-section. These events underscore the vulnerability of the surrounding rural landscape to high-flow conditions in the Ge Dang Zhai River system and highlight the importance of accurate flood forecasting and channel management informed by data collected at GDZ46.\n\nThe integration of physical channel characteristics, historical flood impact data, and hydrological measurements at GDZ46 enables comprehensive analysis of flood behavior and supports the design of mitigation measures to protect nearby communities and farmland. Its strategic placement at the confluence enhances its utility in capturing integrated flow contributions from upstream tributaries, providing a representative snapshot of watershed-scale hydrological dynamics. Overall, GDZ46 functions as both a scientific and practical cornerstone for water management in the region, combining technical specifications with real-world flood impact history to guide infrastructure planning and disaster preparedness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 419, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 704, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
