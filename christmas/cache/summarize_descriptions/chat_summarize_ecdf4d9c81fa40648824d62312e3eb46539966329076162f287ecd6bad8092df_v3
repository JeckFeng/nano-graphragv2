It functions both as a local geographic feature and an integral part of the broader Gedangzhai River system. Recognized as a tributary of the Gendang Zhaihe River—specifically designated as Gendang Zhaihe tributary b (GDZb)—the Wengwei River flows through the Wengwei Group and is officially monitored under the hydrological code GDZb4, indicating its role in regional water resource management and environmental monitoring. \n\nWhile it is formally classified as a tributary, the river is also locally referred to as the main stem within its immediate region, reflecting its prominence and hydrological importance to the surrounding communities. This dual designation underscores its functional significance: though it feeds into the larger Gendang Zhaihe system, it serves as a primary waterway for the local area, particularly for residents of the Wengwei Group.\n\nTo support community access and connectivity, a bridge has been constructed across the Wengwei River, facilitating transportation and daily activities for villagers in Gutyang Village. This infrastructure highlights the river’s role not only in the natural landscape but also in the socio-economic life of the region.\n\nIn summary, the Wengwei River is a monitored tributary (GDZb4) of the Gendang Zhaihe River, flowing through the Wengwei Group of Gutyang Village. Despite its tributary status, it is considered a main stem in local context, emphasizing its regional importance. The presence of a bridge over the river further illustrates its significance to local infrastructure and community livelihood.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 580, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
