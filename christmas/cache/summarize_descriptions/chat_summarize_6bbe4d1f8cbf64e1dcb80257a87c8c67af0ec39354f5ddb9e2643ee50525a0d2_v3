In Guizhou Province, the CORS network has been fully deployed and covers all operational areas, enabling real-time, accurate positioning across the region. This infrastructure provides GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) correction data essential for advanced surveying techniques, particularly Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying, which relies on precise differential corrections to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. By leveraging the CORS network, projects in Guizhou can obtain reliable and consistent positioning information without the need for traditional, time-intensive high-order control surveys. The system plays a critical role in environments where other remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR, may be limited or ineffective—such as in heavily vegetated, mountainous, or otherwise obstructed terrains—by offering a robust alternative for terrain measurement and monitoring through continuous satellite signal tracking. As a continuously operating network, it ensures persistent data availability, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in geodetic, engineering, and mapping applications. The Chinese term for this system, “连续运行参考站系统,” reflects its function as a permanent, integrated network of reference stations that support dynamic positioning and spatial data collection throughout the project area. Overall, the CORS network in Guizhou represents a foundational component of modern geospatial infrastructure, enabling advanced surveying and positioning capabilities across diverse applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 537, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
