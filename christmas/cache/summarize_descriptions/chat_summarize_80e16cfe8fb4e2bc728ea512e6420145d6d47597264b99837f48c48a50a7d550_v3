Located along the Gubin Stream, the village is specifically associated with the GDZA11 cross-section, a designated measurement point used in the study and monitoring of the stream’s flow, depth, and other hydrological characteristics. This cross-section plays an important role in water resource management, flood risk assessment, and geographical analysis of the surrounding area. The dual identification of the village—as both a populated place and a technical survey site—highlights its significance in regional environmental monitoring efforts. GUBIN VILLAGE, therefore, functions not only as a local community but also as a geospatial landmark within scientific and engineering frameworks focused on the hydrology of the Gubin Stream watershed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
