The Tiankan Group functions as a constituent settlement or subgroup within the administrative and geographic boundaries of Huangni Village. It is not an independent village but rather an integral part of the larger village structure, contributing to the social, cultural, and possibly economic fabric of Huangni Village. The relationship between the two entities is hierarchical, with the Tiankan Group falling under the jurisdiction and communal organization of Huangni Village. This arrangement is typical of rural administrative divisions in certain regions, where larger villages are composed of smaller, named residential units or hamlets that share infrastructure, governance, and communal resources. The Tiankan Group, therefore, represents a localized community within the broader context of Huangni Village, maintaining its own identity while being administratively and socially linked to the parent village. Both entities are collectively situated within the same regional and cultural environment, sharing historical development patterns, livelihood practices, and community ties. The consistent descriptions across sources confirm that Tiankan Group is a recognized subunit of Huangni Village, underscoring its role as a smaller settlement embedded within the larger village framework. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions; both emphasize the subordinate and integral nature of the Tiankan Group within Huangni Village. As such, the combined entity can be understood as a multi-layered rural settlement, where Huangni Village serves as the primary administrative unit and the Tiankan Group represents one of its component residential areas. This structure supports localized community life while ensuring cohesion and collective governance under the umbrella of the main village.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 334, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 517, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
