This river plays a notable role in the regional hydrology, contributing to the broader network of waterways that drain the surrounding landscape. As a tributary, it feeds into the larger Chong'an River, helping to shape the watershed's flow dynamics and ecological characteristics.  \n\nThe river has been specifically identified in hydrological studies under the designation \"Chongan River 001,\" indicating its importance in local water management and flood risk assessment. It is subject to flood frequency analysis, which is used to evaluate the likelihood and impact of flooding events in the region. This analysis supports infrastructure planning, disaster preparedness, and environmental conservation efforts in the Gedangzhai vicinity and downstream areas.  \n\nWhile the name \"GE DANG ZHAI RIVER\" reflects its geographical association with the Gedangzhai locality, its alternate identifiers—Chongan River 001 and River 001—highlight its integration into a formalized river classification system. This dual naming convention suggests both community-based recognition and technical administrative use, common in regions where local landmarks are incorporated into scientific and governmental monitoring frameworks.  \n\nDespite the variations in nomenclature, all references point to the same watercourse, confirming its identity as a distinct yet interconnected segment of the Chong'an River network. Its location within the Xiaoyu watershed underscores its environmental significance, particularly in maintaining local water balance, supporting biodiversity, and influencing land use patterns.  \n\nIn summary, the GE DANG ZHAI RIVER (Chongan River 001 or River 001) is a localized tributary in the Xiaoyu watershed near Gedangzhai, integral to the Chong'an River system. It is recognized both in local parlance and technical hydrological assessments, particularly for its role in flood frequency studies. The river serves as an important feature for understanding regional water behavior and managing flood risks, reflecting the intersection of natural geography and environmental governance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 448, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 652, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
