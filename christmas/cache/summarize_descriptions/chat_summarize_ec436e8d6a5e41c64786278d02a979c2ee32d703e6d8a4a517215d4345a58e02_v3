This rural settlement comprises 3 households and is home to 14 residents, reflecting its status as a small, close-knit community. The area is geographically associated with the Gubin Stream, a watercourse that significantly influences the local environment and infrastructure. Notably, the presence of bridge structures in the vicinity underscores the importance of transportation links across the stream, likely serving as critical access points for residents and emergency services.\n\nShuiluodong Group is classified as a high-risk flood zone, with a flood recurrence interval of approximately 2 years, indicating a frequent and recurring exposure to flooding events. This short recurrence interval suggests that the community faces regular hydrological challenges, likely due to its proximity to the Gubin Stream and the surrounding topography. The elevated flood risk poses significant concerns for resident safety, property integrity, and long-term habitability, necessitating ongoing monitoring, flood mitigation strategies, and disaster preparedness planning by local authorities.\n\nDespite discrepancies in the spelling of the village name—appearing as both \"Guyang Village\" and \"Gongyang Village\"—contextual and geographical consistency indicates these refer to the same location, with the variation likely stemming from transliteration differences or administrative record inconsistencies. The integration of both references confirms Shuiluodong Group’s placement within this specific rural village under Xingshan Street’s jurisdiction.\n\nIn summary, Shuiluodong Group is a small, flood-prone village community of 14 people across 3 households, situated in Guyang (Gongyang) Village, Xingshan Street, adjacent to the Gubin Stream. Its frequent exposure to flooding—occurring roughly every two years—highlights its vulnerability to natural hazards, while the presence of stream-crossing bridge structures reflects the area’s infrastructural response to geographic constraints. The community’s size and risk profile underscore the importance of targeted environmental management and resilience-building measures to ensure the safety and sustainability of life in Shuiluodong Group.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 431, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 641, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
