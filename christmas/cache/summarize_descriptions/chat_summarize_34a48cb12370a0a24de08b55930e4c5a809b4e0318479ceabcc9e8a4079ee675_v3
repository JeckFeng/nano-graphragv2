The site is located in Lantan Village and functions as a critical cross-section for measuring and analyzing the relationship between water level and flow rate. This data collection is essential for hydrological modeling, flood forecasting, and water resource management in the region.\n\nThe drainage area contributing to the Gubin Stream at this control section spans 5.98 km², indicating a relatively small yet significant catchment that influences flow dynamics at the measurement point. The physical characteristics of the channel are defined by a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, reflecting the resistance to flow caused by the channel bed and banks, which may include natural features such as vegetation, rocks, and irregular terrain. Additionally, the cross-sectional gradient (J) is measured at 9.94‰ (approximately 0.994%), indicating a moderately steep slope that contributes to faster water movement and influences discharge calculations.\n\nAlthough initial descriptions refer to the location as being along the main stem of the Ge Dang Zhai River, further clarification identifies it as positioned on the Gubin Stream, a tributary within the broader Ge Dang Zhai River watershed. This distinction does not represent a contradiction but rather a refinement of spatial specificity—the control section GDZA4X is part of the larger Ge Dang Zhai River system but is precisely located on the Gubin Stream, enhancing the accuracy of hydrological assessments within the sub-catchment.\n\nAs a monitoring station, GDZA4X plays a vital role in collecting continuous or periodic data on water surface elevation and corresponding discharge, enabling scientists and engineers to establish stage-discharge relationships (rating curves). These relationships are foundational for converting easily measured water levels into volumetric flow rates, which are crucial for managing water resources, assessing flood risks, and supporting environmental flow requirements.\n\nThe integration of geomorphic and hydraulic parameters—such as drainage area, channel roughness, and gradient—into the analysis allows for more accurate modeling of flow behavior under varying hydrological conditions. These attributes also assist in validating field measurements against theoretical calculations using formulas like Manning’s equation.\n\nIn summary, GDZA4X is a well-defined hydrological control cross-section located on the Gubin Stream, a tributary of the Ge Dang Zhai River at Lantan Village, with a drainage area of 5.98 km², channel roughness (n) of 0.052, and a longitudinal gradient (J) of 9.94‰. It serves as a key site for monitoring water level and flow rate dynamics, contributing essential data for scientific, environmental, and engineering applications within the watershed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 585, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 814, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
