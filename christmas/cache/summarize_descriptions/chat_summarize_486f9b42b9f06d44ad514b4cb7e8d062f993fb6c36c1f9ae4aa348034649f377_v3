One of its subordinate administrative units is XINGSHAN SUBDISTRICT, which functions as a township-level division within the county. The hierarchical administrative code 522635001000 confirms the subordinate relationship between the two entities, as the prefix \"522635\" corresponds to Majiang County, while the full code identifies Xingshan Subdistrict as a specific subdistrict under its jurisdiction. This coding structure is consistent with China's standardized system for classifying administrative divisions, where nested numerical codes reflect the hierarchical governance structure.\n\nXingshan Subdistrict is situated geographically and administratively within the boundaries of Majiang County. As a subdistrict, it represents an urban or semi-urban administrative unit typically responsible for local governance, public services, and community management. The presence of such a subdistrict indicates a degree of urbanization or administrative development within Majiang County, particularly in the area governed by Xingshan.\n\nTogether, MAJIANG COUNTY and XINGSHAN SUBDISTRICT form part of the broader administrative framework of rural and urban governance in southwestern China. Majiang County serves as the higher-level authority overseeing multiple township-level divisions, including subdistricts, towns, and townships, with Xingshan Subdistrict being one of them. The integration of Xingshan into the county’s administrative structure ensures coordinated implementation of regional policies, infrastructure development, and social services.\n\nThere are no contradictions among the provided descriptions; all sources consistently affirm that Xingshan Subdistrict is an administrative component of Majiang County, both geographically and hierarchically. The information collectively underscores the structured nature of local governance in China, where subdistricts like Xingshan operate under the supervision of county governments such as that of Majiang. This relationship facilitates effective administration and resource allocation within the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 400, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 608, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
