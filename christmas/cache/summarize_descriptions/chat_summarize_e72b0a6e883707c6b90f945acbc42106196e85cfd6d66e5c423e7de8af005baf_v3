It is also known by the official designation code FE1B1ABA000L and is alternatively identified as Chong'an River 001 in hydrological studies. The river traverses rural settlements including Huangni Village and Basha Village, where it plays a significant role in local water management and flood risk planning. As a small watershed stream, the GEDANGZHAI RIVER is subject to ongoing analysis for its hydraulic behavior, particularly in relation to runoff patterns, rainfall response, and flood forecasting.\n\nThe river’s basin features multiple infrastructure elements aimed at water regulation and monitoring, including several reservoirs and rainfall monitoring stations. These installations support regional efforts to manage flood risks, especially during seasonal rains when upstream catchment areas are prone to rapid water accumulation. The presence of multiple bridges along the river’s course highlights its impact on local transportation networks and underscores the importance of structural resilience against flooding and erosion.\n\nAlthough relatively small in scale, the GEDANGZHAI RIVER is integral to the hydrological dynamics of the Zhongan River system. Its flow is influenced by localized topography and precipitation trends, making it a focus for environmental monitoring and disaster preparedness initiatives. The integration of real-time data from rainfall stations and reservoir operations enables authorities to assess flood potential and implement mitigation strategies in vulnerable communities such as those in Gudong Town, Huangni Village, and Basha Village.\n\nIn summary, the GEDANGZHAI RIVER is a multifaceted watercourse serving hydrological, infrastructural, and environmental functions within the Dongting Lake basin. Designated under multiple identifiers—FE1B1ABA000L and Chong'an River 001—it is recognized both as a local stream with community-level impacts and as a component of a larger river system requiring coordinated flood risk management. Its course through agricultural and residential areas, combined with engineered controls like reservoirs and bridges, reflects the balance between natural processes and human adaptation in a flood-prone region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 679, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
