It originates from the forest farm in Yudong Village, Gudong Town, and travels through several localities including Mayitang and Shankoumen before reaching its confluence point. Spanning a drainage area of 8.23 km², the river plays a notable role in the regional hydrological system. The confluence at Wengwei is part of a multi-tributary junction site, highlighting its significance within the broader river network. A water quality or hydrological monitoring cross-section, designated GDZB4, is located on the Gudangzhai River downstream of this confluence, underscoring the environmental and regulatory importance of the area. Despite minor variations in the naming of the main river—Gudangzhai, Gedangzhai, or Gegendangzai—all references point to the same primary watercourse into which the Wengwei River discharges. This consistency in geography and nomenclature confirms the Wengwei River as a key contributing stream within the Gudangzhai River basin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 523, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
