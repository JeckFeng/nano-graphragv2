It is situated downstream of the confluence of the Gedangzhai River and the Xibu River, serving as a key point for hydrological observation and water management in the region. The drainage area contributing to this section spans 136.43 km², encompassing the combined catchment of both rivers upstream of the confluence. This makes GDZ Downstream 1 a critical location for monitoring flow dynamics, flood risk, and sediment transport in the integrated river system.\n\nThe channel characteristics at GDZ Downstream 1 include a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, indicating a moderately rough channel bed likely influenced by natural riverbed materials such as gravel, vegetation, or irregular topography. The longitudinal slope of the river at this section is 2.2‰ (0.22%), which suggests a relatively gentle gradient typical of mid-to-lower reaches of river systems, facilitating steady flow conditions while still allowing for measurable water movement. These hydraulic properties are essential for modeling discharge, predicting flood behavior, and designing mitigation measures.\n\nAs both a control section and a monitoring point, GDZ Downstream 1 plays a dual role in water resource management. It provides standardized data for hydrological analysis and supports regulatory functions such as flow regulation, water quality assessment, and environmental monitoring. Its precise location on the Xibu River at Sanlian Village ensures that it captures integrated flow conditions after the contribution of the Gedangzhai River, making it representative of the combined hydrological response of the upstream watershed.\n\nIn summary, GDZ Downstream 1 is a strategically positioned hydrological monitoring and control cross-section on the Xibu River at Sanlian Village, downstream of the confluence with the Gedangzhai River. It encompasses a drainage area of 136.43 km² and is characterized by a channel slope of 2.2‰ and a Manning’s roughness coefficient of 0.052. This site is vital for integrated water management, flood forecasting, and environmental monitoring in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
