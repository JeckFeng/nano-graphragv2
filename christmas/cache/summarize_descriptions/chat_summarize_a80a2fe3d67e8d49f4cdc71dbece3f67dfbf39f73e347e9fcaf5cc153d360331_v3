Originating from Dazhai in Daping Village, the stream flows in a southeastward direction from its northwestern source, traversing diverse terrain including Heinitian and Shuiluodong before converging with the Ge Dangzhai River at Lugugu. The total length of the Gubin Stream is approximately 8.94 kilometers, highlighting its role as a significant local tributary within the regional hydrological network.\n\nThe stream passes through several village groups in the Guyang Village area, indicating its importance to local communities, both as a natural feature and a potential resource for agriculture or daily use. Its path intersects with multiple infrastructure elements, including several bridges, which likely support transportation and connectivity across the stream, further emphasizing its integration into the social and physical landscape of the region.\n\nHydrological assessments have been conducted on the Gubin Stream, particularly focusing on its water surface profile. These analyses contribute to understanding the stream’s flow behavior, flood potential, and overall water management, especially given its role as a tributary feeding into a larger river system. The designation of Gubin Stream as tributary 'a' of the Gedang River underscores its formal recognition within regional water resource documentation and planning.\n\nWhile the stream is known by multiple names—including Gubin Stream and Valley Bin Stream—these references pertain to the same watercourse, reflecting either linguistic variations or local naming conventions. The convergence of geographical, infrastructural, and hydrological data confirms the stream’s consistent identification across sources, with no irreconcilable contradictions in the descriptions provided.\n\nIn summary, GUBIN STREAM (Valley Bin Stream) is an 8.94-km-long tributary originating in Daping Village's Dazhai, flowing through Heinitian, Shuiluodong, and the Guyang Village area, passing under several bridges and through multiple village groups, before joining the Ge Dangzhai River at Lugugu. It plays a vital role in the local environment and community infrastructure, supported by formal hydrological studies of its water surface profile.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 474, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 734, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
