It is geometrically corrected to eliminate distortions caused by terrain relief, sensor orientation, and camera tilt, resulting in an accurate, map-like representation of the Earth's surface. This precise correction allows the DOM to serve as a reliable foundation for visual interpretation, spatial analysis, and integration with other geographic data layers, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEM), particularly in the construction of geospatial database baseplates.\n\nThe DOM is typically generated at a scale of 1:2000, making it suitable for detailed land use planning, environmental monitoring, and urban development applications. It is produced using high-quality aerial imagery that undergoes rigorous orthorectification processes to ensure spatial accuracy. Notably, the ground resolution of the DOM can reach up to 0.2 meters, enabling fine-scale analysis of terrain features and surface structures. This level of detail supports applications requiring high positional accuracy, such as infrastructure mapping, cadastral surveying, and change detection over time.\n\nAs a key component of modern geospatial datasets, the Digital Orthophoto Map combines the visual characteristics of a photograph with the geometric properties of a map. It allows users to accurately measure distances, areas, and directions while visually identifying natural and man-made features on the ground. Its integration with DEMs enhances three-dimensional modeling and visualization, improving the interpretation of topographic and land cover characteristics.\n\nIn summary, DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) is a vital tool in geospatial science, offering a geometrically accurate, high-resolution representation of the Earth's surface derived from aerial imagery. With a ground resolution of 0.2 meters and production at a 1:2000 scale, it supports a wide range of applications in mapping, spatial analysis, and database construction, particularly when combined with auxiliary data such as DEMs. Its dual capacity for visual clarity and metric precision makes it indispensable in both scientific and practical geographic applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
