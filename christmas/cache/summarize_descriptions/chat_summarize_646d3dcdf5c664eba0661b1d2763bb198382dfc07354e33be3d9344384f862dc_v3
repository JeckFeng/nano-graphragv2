The site serves multiple functions, primarily as a designated control section for collecting and analyzing hydrological data, supporting water resource management and flood risk assessment. It is associated with a drainage area of 5.98 km² and features a channel slope of 9.94‰, with a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, indicating moderate flow resistance typical of natural, possibly rocky or vegetated stream channels.\n\nGDZA4X functions as a right-bank cross-section point on what is alternatively described as Gubin Stream or Branch A of the Gudangzhai River system, suggesting it is part of a branched network within the broader Gedangzhai River watershed. It is paired with another measurement point, GDZA4S, to facilitate comparative hydraulic modeling and cross-sectional flow analysis. This pairing enables more accurate simulations of water surface profiles, flood discharges, and sediment transport, particularly in complex or divergent channel systems.\n\nAdditionally, GDZA4X is recognized as a formal designation code for a hazard zone within the Shuiluodong area, indicating its importance in local floodplain mapping and disaster preparedness planning. Its dual role—as both a technical monitoring point and a risk assessment marker—underscores its significance in regional water safety infrastructure.\n\nThe cross-section may also serve as an auxiliary or alternate measurement location relative to the main stem of the Gedangzhai River, providing supplementary data to enhance the robustness of hydrological records, particularly during extreme flow events or when primary stations are compromised. This redundancy supports continuous monitoring and improves data reliability for modeling and emergency response.\n\nIn summary, GDZA4X is a multifunctional hydrological control and monitoring point on Gubin Stream (a tributary of the Gedangzhai River) at Shuiluodong, Lantang, Xingshan Town. It plays a critical role in data collection, hydraulic modeling (in coordination with GDZA4S), and hazard zone designation, contributing to both scientific understanding and public safety within the watershed. Its physical characteristics include a 5.98 km² drainage area, 9.94‰ channel slope, and a Manning’s n value of 0.052, reflecting its geomorphic and hydraulic environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 530, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 855, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
