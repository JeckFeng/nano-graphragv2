This site serves as a critical measurement point for monitoring water levels, discharge rates, and flood behavior within the river system. Designated for its role in analyzing the relationship between water level and discharge, GDZ46 has been instrumental in hydrological studies and flood risk assessment in the region. \n\nHistorical hydrological data collected at this control section include records of significant flood events, most notably the 1996 flood, which registered a peak flow of 376 cubic meters per second (m³/s). This measurement provides a key benchmark for understanding flood patterns and validating hydrological models. Additionally, GDZ46 has been used in the determination of design flood values for engineering and infrastructure planning; the site is associated with a 2% annual exceedance probability (AEP) design flood of 387 m³/s, indicating its importance in flood protection and water resource management strategies.\n\nAs a formally recognized hydrological measurement point at Xiao Zhai, GDZ46 supports long-term data collection efforts essential for watershed management and climate impact studies. Its strategic location at the confluence zone enhances its utility in capturing integrated flow dynamics from upstream reaches of the Ge'dangzhai River. The consistency of monitoring at this site enables reliable trend analysis and supports both operational forecasting and regulatory decision-making.\n\nIn summary, GDZ46 functions as a vital hydrological control and observation station on the Ge'dangzhai River at Xiaozhai, combining historical flood documentation, real-time discharge monitoring, and design flood analysis. Its data contribute significantly to water resource planning, flood modeling, and infrastructure resilience in the surrounding river basin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
