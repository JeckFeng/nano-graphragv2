Situated in Wengwei Village, this control section plays a critical role in hydrological monitoring and water surface profile calculations for the surrounding watershed. The area encompassed by the watershed associated with GDZB4 spans 8.23 km², reflecting its significance in managing localized water flow and drainage patterns. The channel slope at this section is notably steep, measuring 11.06‰, which influences the velocity and behavior of water movement through the area. This steep gradient contributes to the dynamic hydrological characteristics of the river system, making GDZB4 an important reference point for flood modeling, water resource management, and engineering studies in the region. While one description refers to the Ge'dangzhai River directly, the more precise identification places GDZB4 on the Wengwei River, clarifying that it is not on the main stem of the Ge'dangzhai River but rather on one of its tributaries. This distinction resolves any apparent contradiction between the descriptions by contextualizing the geographic hierarchy: the Wengwei River feeds into the Ge'dangzhai River system, and GDZB4 serves as a key control point within this network. Overall, GDZB4 functions as a vital hydrological reference for understanding flow dynamics, flood risks, and watershed behavior in this mountainous or sloped terrain. Its data supports infrastructure planning, environmental assessments, and disaster prevention measures in Wengwei Village and the broader Ge'dangzhai River basin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 549, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
