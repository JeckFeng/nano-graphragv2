It is primarily used to accurately determine the position and orientation of aerial platforms by integrating and analyzing data from inertial measurement units (IMUs), global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), and other onboard sensors. The software plays a critical role in enhancing the geospatial accuracy of data collected during aerial surveys, making it indispensable in applications such as topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.\n\nIn addition to POS data processing, INERTIAL EXPLORER is also utilized for the computational analysis of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point cloud data acquired by UAVs. It functions as a data processing software that enables the integration and refinement of raw laser scanning data with inertial and positional information. This integration allows for the generation of highly accurate, georeferenced 3D point clouds, which are essential for creating detailed digital elevation models, terrain analyses, and 3D reconstructions of complex environments.\n\nThe software is specifically engineered to handle the fusion of multiple data streams—such as laser point clouds and inertial data—through sophisticated algorithms that reduce errors caused by sensor drift, vibration, and signal latency. By resolving these inconsistencies during post-processing, INERTIAL EXPLORER ensures high-fidelity output that meets the rigorous standards of geospatial professionals.\n\nOverall, INERTIAL EXPLORER serves as a comprehensive solution for processing multi-source sensor data from UAV-based remote sensing missions. Its capabilities span the accurate解算 (computation and resolution) of both POS and LiDAR datasets, enabling users to achieve precise, reliable, and actionable geospatial intelligence. Whether used for engineering surveys, natural resource management, or infrastructure planning, the software provides a robust platform for transforming raw aerial data into accurate, high-resolution spatial models. Its integration of inertial navigation and laser scanning technologies makes it a vital tool in modern photogrammetry and remote sensing workflows.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 422, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 646, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
