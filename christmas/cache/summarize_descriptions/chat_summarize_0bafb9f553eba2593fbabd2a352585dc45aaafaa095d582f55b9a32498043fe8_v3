Guyang Village, located within the jurisdiction of Xingshan Street, contains five specific flash flood risk groups, highlighting the area’s vulnerability to natural hazards, particularly flooding. As a constituent part of Xingshan Street, Guyang Village falls under its governance and administrative framework, which is responsible for local management, disaster preparedness, and community planning. The inclusion of these five high-risk groups within Guyang Village underscores the need for targeted flood mitigation strategies and emergency response measures in the region. Together, Xingshan Street and Guyang Village form a cohesive administrative and geographic unit, where local governance addresses both developmental and environmental challenges, especially those related to flash flood risks. The relationship between the two entities is hierarchical, with Xingshan Street serving as the broader administrative authority and Guyang Village functioning as a localized community within it, contributing to the social and demographic fabric of the area. This integrated structure enables coordinated planning and risk management, particularly vital given the identified flash flood vulnerabilities in Guyang Village’s subgroups.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
