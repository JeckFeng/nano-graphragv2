Situated along the course of the Ge Dang Zhai River, the village lies within a watershed area that is subject to hydrological monitoring and flood risk assessment. HUANGNI VILLAGE comprises several sub-groups, including Da Po, Xing Long, Tian Kan, and Xin Zhuang, which together form a dispersed rural community vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly flash floods. Its position in a mountainous and riverine environment contributes to its susceptibility to rapid-onset flooding events, especially during periods of intense rainfall or upstream water discharge.\n\nThe village is notably associated with the Dapu Group landslide, a geohazard located within its vicinity, which further amplifies the environmental risks faced by local residents. This landslide feature underscores the area's geological instability and the need for ongoing monitoring and risk mitigation. In response to these hazards, HUANGNI VILLAGE hosts a designated monitoring point, labeled GDZ8, which plays a critical role in the watershed’s flood discharge calculations. Data collected from GDZ8 supports regional hydrological modeling and informs early warning systems, helping to manage flood risks for the village and surrounding areas.\n\nThe integration of HUANGNI VILLAGE into formal monitoring networks reflects its strategic importance in understanding and managing water flow dynamics in the Ge Dang Zhai River basin. The presence of multiple hamlets within the village indicates a complex settlement pattern, where different groups may experience varying degrees of exposure to environmental threats depending on their specific location within the landscape. As such, coordinated disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning are essential to safeguarding the community.\n\nOverall, HUANGNI VILLAGE is a geographically and hydrologically significant settlement in Gudong Town, shaped by its location along the Ge Dang Zhai River, its association with the Dapu Group landslide, and its role in regional flood monitoring. The combination of natural hazards—particularly flash floods and landslides—necessitates continuous environmental surveillance and community resilience efforts. Through monitoring point GDZ8 and inclusive risk management strategies, HUANGNI VILLAGE remains a focal point for watershed safety and disaster prevention in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 462, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 694, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
