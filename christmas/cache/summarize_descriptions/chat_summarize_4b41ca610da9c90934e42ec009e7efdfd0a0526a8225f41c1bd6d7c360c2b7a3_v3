It serves as a key site for scientific study and monitoring, particularly in understanding local hydrological behavior and flood dynamics. The river flows into the Xibu River at a location known as Xiaozhai, marking a significant confluence point within the regional drainage system. Due to its strategic position and hydrological relevance, the GEDANGZHAI RIVER has been the focus of flood investigations aimed at assessing flow patterns, water levels, and potential flood risks in the surrounding area. These studies contribute to broader efforts in watershed management and disaster preparedness within the Chongan River basin. As part of a monitored small watershed, GDZ plays an essential role in collecting empirical data that supports water resource planning and environmental conservation initiatives. The integration of field measurements and flood analysis at this site enhances the understanding of river behavior under varying climatic and hydrological conditions, making the GEDANGZHAI RIVER a vital component of regional hydrological research.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
