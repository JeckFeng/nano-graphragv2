The village is notable for its hydrological significance, as it contains the hydrological cross-section designated GDZa11, which is utilized for flood analysis and water flow assessment. This cross-section plays a critical role in evaluating flood risks and managing water resources in the area. In addition to its hydrological monitoring functions, GUBIN VILLAGE has been the site of structural assessments related to water flow obstruction. Measurements of obstructing structures within the village have been recorded, particularly at specific cross-sections, to evaluate how built infrastructure may impact the natural flow of the stream, especially during high-water events. These measurements support efforts to mitigate flood hazards and improve drainage efficiency. The combined focus on hydrological monitoring and infrastructure assessment highlights the village’s importance in regional flood management strategies. GUBIN VILLAGE thus serves both as a residential community and a key location for environmental and civil engineering studies aimed at enhancing resilience to hydrological events.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
