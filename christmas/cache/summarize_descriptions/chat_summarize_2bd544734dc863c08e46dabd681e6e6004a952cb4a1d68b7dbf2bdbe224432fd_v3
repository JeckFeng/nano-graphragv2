It functions as a tributary of the Zhonganjiang River and ultimately flows into the Xibu River, integrating into a broader river system that supports regional hydrology and flood management. The river traverses or runs near several villages, including Huangni Village, Gudong Village, and Baisha Village, where it is crossed by multiple bridges and monitored closely due to its role in local flood control infrastructure.\n\nThe catchment area of the GEDANGZHAI RIVER includes several key reservoirs—Mianhuachong, Mayitang, and Xiaoba—which contribute to water regulation and storage within the basin. The river's hydrological behavior is closely observed through a network of rainfall monitoring stations located at strategic points such as Lanshan, Baisha, Xiaoba, Mayitang, and Mianhuachong. These stations provide critical data for flood forecasting and water resource management in the region.\n\nMultiple control cross-sections along the river—including GDZ46, GDZB4, GDZA4X, and GDZA11—are used in hydrological assessments, particularly in flood analysis. These evaluations employ Manning's formula to calculate flow characteristics and support engineering decisions related to channel capacity and flood risk mitigation. The river's flow dynamics are also influenced by anthropogenic structures in its vicinity, contributing to a measured obstruction area ratio of 4.53%. This level of obstruction is attributed to nearby developments, including the Majiang County Gold Egg Tray Processing Factory, which is situated close to the riverbank.\n\nThe presence of infrastructure such as bridges and flood control systems underscores the river’s importance to local communities and its integration into regional development planning. Its path through agriculturally and residentially significant areas necessitates ongoing monitoring and management to balance ecological health with human activity. The combination of natural catchment features, engineered controls, and environmental monitoring reflects a comprehensive approach to sustaining the river's functionality within the landscape of Majiang County.\n\nOverall, the GEDANGZHAI RIVER serves as a vital component of the local hydrological network, supporting flood regulation, water monitoring, and community infrastructure across multiple villages while being subject to careful assessment and management due to its interaction with both natural and built environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 478, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 835, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
