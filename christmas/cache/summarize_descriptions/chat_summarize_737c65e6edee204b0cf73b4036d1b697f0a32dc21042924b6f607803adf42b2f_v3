It functions as a geographical and administrative unit encompassing several village groups and essential infrastructure, serving as a key component of the local governance and community structure within the region. The street plays a significant role in the organization and management of local populations and resources, supporting both residential and developmental activities.\n\nOne of the notable characteristics of Xingshan Street is its vulnerability to flooding. The area contains seven zones identified as having dangerous flood risk, with five of these classified as historical flood-prone areas due to recurring incidents over time. These long-standing risks have likely influenced local planning and disaster preparedness measures. In addition to these established danger zones, two newly identified flood risk areas have recently been recognized, indicating that environmental or infrastructural changes may be contributing to evolving hydrological challenges. The presence of both historical and newly detected high-risk zones underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring, flood mitigation strategies, and community awareness initiatives within Xingshan Street.\n\nThe combination of administrative responsibilities, community habitation, and environmental risk factors positions Xingshan Street as a focal point for integrated urban and rural management in Majiang County. Local authorities are likely tasked with balancing developmental needs against the imperatives of safety and resilience, particularly in the context of climate variability and increased flood frequency. Infrastructure projects and village-level governance within the street must therefore consider flood risk mitigation, emergency response planning, and long-term environmental sustainability.\n\nIn summary, Xingshan Street (杏山街) is a vital administrative and residential area in Majiang County, composed of multiple village groups and supporting local infrastructure. While it serves as a center for community life and governance, it also faces significant environmental challenges due to its seven dangerous flood risk zones—five historical and two newly identified. These conditions necessitate coordinated efforts in risk management, urban planning, and community preparedness to ensure the safety and sustainability of the area and its residents.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 593, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
