As a subordinate administrative unit, Guyang Village is officially part of Xingshan Street, reflecting the hierarchical structure of local governance. This relationship is consistent across available descriptions, both of which confirm that Guyang Village falls under the jurisdiction and territorial management of Xingshan Street.\n\nNotably, Guyang Village contains multiple high-risk flash flood zones, indicating a significant environmental and safety concern for its residents. This vulnerability underscores the importance of disaster preparedness and mitigation measures within the village, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall or extreme weather events. The presence of such high-risk areas calls for coordinated efforts between local authorities in Xingshan Street and emergency management agencies to monitor, respond to, and reduce the potential impact of flash floods on the community.\n\nIn summary, Xingshan Street serves as the governing administrative body for Guyang Village, with the latter being an integral part of the former’s territorial jurisdiction. The administrative connection ensures that governance, public services, and disaster risk management initiatives are managed at the level of Xingshan Street, while specifically addressing localized challenges such as the flash flood risks present in Guyang Village. Together, Xingshan Street and Guyang Village represent a closely linked administrative and geographic unit, where regional planning and safety protocols must consider both governance structures and environmental vulnerabilities. This integrated approach is essential for ensuring the well-being and resilience of the population in this area.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
