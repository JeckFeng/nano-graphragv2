Positioned at a starting distance of 648 meters along the river, this cross-section features a thalweg elevation of 997.468 meters, representing the lowest point of the riverbed at that location. During observations, the measured water edge elevation was recorded at 997.684 meters, indicating the vertical extent of water during specific flow conditions. \n\nGDZ5 plays a significant role in water surface profile calculations for various flood frequency scenarios, including 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% annual exceedance probabilities. These profiles are essential for flood risk assessment, hydraulic modeling, and infrastructure planning in the surrounding region. The data collected at GDZ5 supports both operational flood forecasting and long-term water resource management strategies by providing accurate, real-time, and historical hydrological benchmarks.\n\nAs a formally established monitoring cross-section, GDZ5 is strategically positioned to capture representative flow characteristics of the Gedangzhai River, particularly under varying discharge conditions. Its location at Dapo underscores its importance in regional flood monitoring networks, enabling authorities to track water levels, validate model predictions, and issue timely warnings during high-flow events. The integration of GDZ5 into broader hydrological studies ensures consistency and reliability in assessing river behavior across different return periods.\n\nIn summary, GDZ5 functions as both a hydrological control section and a flood monitoring station on the Gedangzhai River at Dapo. With a precisely documented thalweg elevation of 997.468 m and a recorded water edge elevation of 997.684 m, it provides foundational data for water surface profiling under multiple flood frequency analyses. Its role in supporting flood forecasting, hydraulic modeling, and water resource planning highlights its importance in managing the hydrological dynamics of the Gedangzhai River basin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 414, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
