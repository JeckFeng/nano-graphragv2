It is widely used in geospatial applications to enhance the accuracy of positioning and orientation data derived from Position and Orientation Systems (POS) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By integrating raw data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GNSS receivers, INERTIAL EXPLORER enables precise trajectory determination, which is critical for improving the georeferencing accuracy of aerial imagery and point cloud data generated through LiDAR or photogrammetry.\n\nThe software supports advanced data fusion algorithms that combine GNSS signals with inertial measurements to deliver high-precision positioning, even in environments where satellite coverage may be intermittent or degraded. This capability makes INERTIAL EXPLORER particularly valuable in challenging terrains such as urban canyons, dense forests, or mountainous regions, where maintaining continuous and accurate positioning is essential for reliable survey outcomes.\n\nAs a data processing solution, INERTIAL EXPLORER plays a key role in post-mission analysis by enabling post-processed kinematic (PPK) and sometimes real-time kinematic (RTK) data refinement. This post-processing approach significantly improves the accuracy of spatial data compared to standalone GNSS solutions, achieving centimeter-level precision in position and orientation. The resulting high-fidelity POS data is then applied to correct and align sensor data—such as LiDAR point clouds or high-resolution imagery—ensuring that the final geospatial products are both geometrically accurate and reliably aligned with ground coordinates.\n\nUsed extensively in aerial surveying, precision mapping, and drone-based inspection operations, INERTIAL EXPLORER bridges the gap between raw sensor data and actionable, high-accuracy geospatial information. Its ability to process complex, time-synchronized datasets from integrated GNSS-inertial systems makes it an essential tool for professionals in geomatics, civil engineering, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. In Chinese-speaking contexts, it is recognized as a data processing software (数据解算软件) specifically designed for enhancing the positioning accuracy of point cloud data by integrating GNSS and inertial navigation system data collected from drones.\n\nIn summary, INERTIAL EXPLORER is a powerful, industry-standard software solution for high-precision GNSS and inertial data processing, enabling accurate and reliable positioning and orientation solutions in drone-based and other mobile mapping applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 514, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 735, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
