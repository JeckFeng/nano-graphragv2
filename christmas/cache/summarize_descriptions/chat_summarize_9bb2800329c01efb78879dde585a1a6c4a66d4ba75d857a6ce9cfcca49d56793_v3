During comprehensive field surveys conducted as part of a flood risk prevention initiative, 11 flash flood hazard zones were identified within the town—all classified as newly identified danger zones. These findings highlight GUTONG TOWN’s susceptibility to flash floods and underscore the importance of targeted mitigation efforts.\n\nThe town is situated within the Chonganjiang 001 watershed, where it plays a significant role in regional flood management. Out of the 18 total flood prevention targets designated in the Chonganjiang 001 watershed, GUTONG TOWN hosts 11, making it a focal point for flood control and early warning systems. This concentration of prevention targets aligns with the identification of the same 11 hazard zones, indicating that each designated prevention target corresponds to a specific high-risk area within the town. As such, GUTONG TOWN is both a hotspot for flash flood risks and a priority area for infrastructure and monitoring investments aimed at reducing disaster impact.\n\nThe surveys that led to these designations were part of broader efforts to enhance community resilience and improve emergency response in flood-prone regions of Majiang County. By identifying and classifying these zones as newly recognized dangers, authorities aim to implement timely evacuation plans, public awareness campaigns, and engineering solutions to mitigate potential loss of life and property.\n\nIn summary, GUTONG TOWN is a critical node in the flood risk management network of the Chonganjiang 001 watershed. With all 11 of its identified flash flood hazard zones also serving as designated flood prevention targets, the town exemplifies a high-priority area where environmental risk and proactive disaster preparedness intersect. Continued monitoring, community engagement, and infrastructure development are essential to ensuring long-term safety and resilience for its residents.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 380, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 605, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
