It serves as a designated control point for hydrological observation and water resource management within this drainage system. The cross-section, formally referred to as GDZa11, is located in a catchment area that spans 11.99 km², encompassing the surrounding watershed that contributes runoff to the Gubin Stream at this location. The stream segment at GDZA11 exhibits a channel slope of 10.56‰, indicating a moderately steep gradient that influences flow velocity and sediment transport characteristics. The channel roughness, represented by a Manning’s n coefficient of 0.052, reflects the resistance to flow caused by the streambed and banks, which may consist of natural materials such as gravel, vegetation, and irregular topography typical of mountainous or rural streams.\n\nThis monitoring site plays a key role in collecting hydrological data, including water level, discharge, and potentially water quality parameters, to support flood forecasting, environmental assessment, and watershed management initiatives within the Gedangzhai River basin. The data gathered at GDZA11 contributes to a broader understanding of runoff generation processes, sediment dynamics, and the impacts of land use changes in the region. Its location in Gubin Village situates it within a rural landscape, where agricultural activities and natural land cover likely dominate the contributing drainage area.\n\nAlthough the entity is referenced with slightly different capitalization (\"GDZA11\" vs. \"GDZa11\") across sources, these refer to the same monitoring cross-section, with the variation likely attributable to typographical or formatting inconsistencies. The standardized identifier for this station is best represented as GDZA11 in uppercase for consistency with common hydrological station nomenclature. Together, the physical characteristics—drainage area, slope, and roughness—and its function as a monitoring point underscore the importance of GDZA11 in the scientific and operational management of water resources in the Gedangzhai River system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 429, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 656, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
