This monitoring site serves as a critical point for observing and analyzing the relationship between water level and flow rate, supporting hydrological assessments and water resource management in the region. The control cross-section encompasses a watershed area of 136.43 km², which contributes to the runoff dynamics measured at this location. \n\nThe physical characteristics of the river channel at GDZ DOWNSTREAM 1 include a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, indicating a moderately rough channel bed likely influenced by natural features such as gravel, vegetation, or irregular riverbed topography. The section gradient (J) is measured at 2.2‰ (or 0.22%), reflecting a relatively gentle slope typical of downstream river segments, which influences flow velocity and sediment transport capacity. These hydraulic parameters are essential for modeling flow behavior, predicting flood events, and calibrating hydrological models.\n\nAs a designated monitoring station, GDZ DOWNSTREAM 1 plays a key role in collecting continuous data on water surface elevation and discharge, enabling the development of stage-discharge rating curves. These curves are vital for converting easily measured water levels into accurate flow rate estimates, particularly during high-flow or flood conditions when direct measurements are challenging. The confluence upstream of this section means that the hydrological signal integrates inputs from both the Gedangzhai and Xibu Rivers, making the site representative of the combined watershed’s response to precipitation and land use changes.\n\nOverall, GDZ DOWNSTREAM 1 functions as an important node in the regional hydrological monitoring network, providing reliable data for water management, flood forecasting, and environmental flow assessments. Its strategic location, well-defined watershed characteristics, and documented hydraulic properties make it a valuable reference point for both operational and research applications in river hydrology.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
