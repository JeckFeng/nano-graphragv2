Located near Xiao Zhai village, this cross-section functions as a key measurement location within a watershed area of 77.56 km², supporting comprehensive data collection for hydrological analysis and water resource management. The site is specifically designated for monitoring flow dynamics under varying conditions, particularly during flood events, and plays an important role in understanding the behavior of water fields in the surrounding region.\n\nThe physical characteristics of the GDZ46 cross-section include a channel roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, indicating moderate resistance to flow due to the channel bed and banks, and a section gradient (J) of 3.49‰, reflecting a relatively gentle slope that influences the velocity and discharge capacity of the river system. These parameters are essential for hydraulic modeling and flood forecasting in the basin. As a control cross-section, GDZ46 enables consistent and standardized measurements of river discharge and water stage, facilitating long-term trend analysis and calibration of hydrological models.\n\nIts strategic location at the confluence of two rivers enhances its significance, as it integrates flow contributions from both the Gedangzhai and Xibu Rivers, capturing combined hydrological responses from the upstream catchment. This makes GDZ46 particularly valuable for assessing flood risks, managing water resources, and supporting infrastructure planning in downstream areas. The proximity to Xiao Zhai village also underscores its relevance for local flood warning systems and community safety measures.\n\nIn summary, GDZ46 is a well-defined hydrological monitoring point that combines precise geographic placement, detailed physical parameters, and functional importance in water data collection. It supports scientific and practical applications in hydrology, including discharge measurement, flood observation, and watershed management within the Gedangzhai River system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 636, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
