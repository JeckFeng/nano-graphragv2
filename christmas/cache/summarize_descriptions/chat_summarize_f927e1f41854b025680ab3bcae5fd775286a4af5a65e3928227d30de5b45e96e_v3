This network ensures comprehensive coverage throughout the region, enabling reliable and accurate satellite-based positioning for various surveying, mapping, and geospatial applications within the project. As a continuously operating system, CORS provides real-time, high-accuracy positioning data by maintaining a permanent network of fixed GNSS reference stations that continuously collect and transmit satellite observation data.\n\nOne of the key functions of CORS is to support high-precision dynamic satellite positioning measurements, particularly in challenging environments such as laser point cloud blind areas—regions where traditional LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology may fail due to obstructions, dense vegetation, or other limitations. In such scenarios, CORS leverages GNSS technology to deliver precise location information, ensuring continuity and reliability in data acquisition where other remote sensing methods are ineffective.\n\nBy integrating GNSS data from multiple reference stations, the CORS network enhances positioning accuracy through differential correction techniques, allowing for centimeter-level precision in real-time kinematic (RTK) and post-processed applications. This capability is essential for infrastructure development, topographic surveying, deformation monitoring, and transportation planning within Guizhou, a region characterized by complex terrain and diverse geological conditions.\n\nThe system operates as a foundational geospatial tool, facilitating seamless coordination between ground-based measurements and satellite observations. Its continuous operation ensures that users can access reliable reference data at any time, improving efficiency and reducing the need for traditional baseline surveys. Additionally, CORS supports a wide range of disciplines including urban planning, natural resource management, and disaster prevention, where precise spatial data is paramount.\n\nIn summary, CORS—functioning as both a regional GNSS reference network and a specialized solution for high-accuracy positioning in laser point cloud blind zones—plays a vital role in advancing geospatial capabilities in Guizhou. By combining continuous data collection, broad coverage, and high-precision correction services, the CORS network enables robust, efficient, and accurate positioning solutions across diverse operational and environmental conditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 621, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
