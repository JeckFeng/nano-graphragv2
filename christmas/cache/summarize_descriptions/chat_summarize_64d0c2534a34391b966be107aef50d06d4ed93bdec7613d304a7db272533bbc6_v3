It lies within the jurisdiction of the Chonganjiang watershed and has been included in official flood hazard and flood risk investigations due to its vulnerability to hydrological risks. The village contains multiple high-risk flash flood zones, specifically identified as Lujiqiao, Lugu, Shuiluodong, Wengwei, Gubin, and Taitang groups, which are closely monitored for flood prevention and disaster mitigation efforts. These designations highlight the area’s susceptibility to extreme weather events and underscore the importance of infrastructure and emergency planning in the region.\n\nGeographically and infrastructurally, Guyang Village features several river bridges and concrete weir dams, which play a role in local water management and transportation. Additionally, the village is the location of the under-construction Xiniutan Reservoir, a significant development that may further influence water control, flood mitigation, and regional resource management. The construction of this reservoir aligns with broader efforts to manage water resources in high-risk areas and could contribute to both risk reduction and sustainable development in the area.\n\nThe inclusion of Guyang Village in formal flood risk assessments reflects its strategic and environmental significance within the Chonganjiang watershed. Authorities have prioritized data collection and monitoring in the village to improve early warning systems and emergency response protocols, particularly given the presence of multiple vulnerable zones. Combined, the infrastructure, ongoing projects like the Xiniutan Reservoir, and the identified flash flood-prone areas illustrate the complex interplay between natural hazards and engineered solutions in Guyang Village.\n\nIn summary, Guyang Village is a strategically important settlement in Xingshan Street, Majiang County, marked by its role in regional water management and flood risk mitigation. It hosts critical infrastructure such as river bridges, weir dams, and the developing Xiniutan Reservoir, while also being home to several high-risk flash flood areas. Its inclusion in watershed-level hazard investigations underscores the need for continued monitoring, planning, and investment to ensure community safety and environmental sustainability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 704, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
