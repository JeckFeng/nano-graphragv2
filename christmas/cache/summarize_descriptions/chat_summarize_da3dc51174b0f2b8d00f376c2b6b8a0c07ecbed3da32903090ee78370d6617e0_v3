It originates in Gudong Village, Gudong Town, and flows from northwest to southeast through Mangya Village, Huangni Village, and the settlement of Gedangzhai. At Wachang, the river makes a distinct turn toward the northeast. As it flows through these areas, the river passes near or through several human settlements, with its floodplain posing potential risks to nearby communities. Notably, settlements in close proximity to the river are more vulnerable to flooding, while those situated farther away—such as Laowachong and Piepozhai—are not considered at significant risk from flood events.\n\nThe Gedangzhai River is part of a monitored river system with multiple designated control sections, labeled GDZ2 through GDZ9. These sections are critical for hydrological studies, particularly for conducting water surface line calculations used in flood frequency analysis. These analyses help assess flood risks and inform flood management strategies along the river corridor. The presence of infrastructure such as bridges and堰dams (weirs or small dams) along the river—especially in the area of Gudangzhai—plays a significant role in altering natural water flow. These structures can obstruct the river, leading to water impoundment and increased flood potential during periods of high discharge.\n\nDue to the combination of topographical features, flow dynamics, and human-made obstructions, flood risk management is a key concern for the Gedangzhai River. The river’s behavior during heavy rainfall events is closely studied using hydrological modeling at the control sections to predict water levels and flow patterns. These efforts are essential for protecting communities located within the active floodplain and for guiding sustainable development in the surrounding areas.\n\nIn summary, the Gedangzhai River is a geographically and hydrologically significant watercourse in Majiang County, contributing to the broader Chong’an River system. Its path through populated villages, the presence of flow-regulating structures, and its inclusion in systematic flood analysis underscore its importance for regional water management and disaster prevention planning. Continued monitoring and infrastructure maintenance are vital to mitigating flood risks and ensuring the safety of riverside settlements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 465, "prompt_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 785, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
