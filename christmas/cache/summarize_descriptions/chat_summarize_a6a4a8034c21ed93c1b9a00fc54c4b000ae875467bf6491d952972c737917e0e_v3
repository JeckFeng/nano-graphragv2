Situated along a riverine environment, the group is associated with both the Wengwei River and the Gendang Zhaihe River, indicating its proximity to multiple water bodies that contribute to its hydrological risk profile. As part of the rural administrative division, WENGWEI GROUP comprises 5 households with a total population of 23 residents, making it a small, close-knit hamlet vulnerable to environmental hazards.\n\nThe settlement has been officially identified as a high-risk flood danger zone due to its low-lying location along the riverbank. Historical data and flood modeling highlight its susceptibility to river flooding, particularly under extreme weather conditions. Hydrological assessments have analyzed WENGWEI GROUP’s exposure under 1% (100-year) and 2% (50-year) annual chance flood scenarios, both of which indicate significant risk to life and property. These analyses are supported by monitoring infrastructure, including designated hydrological cross-sections GDZ28 and GDZb4 along the Gendang Zhaihe River, which are used to collect real-time rainfall and water level data for early warning systems.\n\nTo mitigate flood risks, established rainfall warning indicators have been implemented in the area, enabling local authorities to issue timely alerts and evacuation orders when critical thresholds are reached. The combination of geographic vulnerability, small population size, and active monitoring underscores the importance of ongoing disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning for WENGWEI GROUP. \n\nDespite minor discrepancies in the naming of the associated rivers—Wengwei River versus Gendang Zhaihe—the spatial and administrative details confirm that these references pertain to the same settlement group. It is likely that the Wengwei River is a tributary or local name connected to the broader Gendang Zhaihe river system, with the group situated at a confluence or along a stretch where both names are relevant. This dual reference highlights the complex fluvial geography of the region and reinforces the need for integrated flood management strategies.\n\nIn summary, WENGWEI GROUP is a small, historically flood-prone village group in Guyang Village, Xingshan Street, Guizhou Province, home to 23 people across five households. Its location along the Wengwei and Gendang Zhaihe rivers places it at high risk for riverine flooding, prompting the establishment of hydrological monitoring points and rainfall-based early warning systems to protect its residents.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 524, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 817, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
