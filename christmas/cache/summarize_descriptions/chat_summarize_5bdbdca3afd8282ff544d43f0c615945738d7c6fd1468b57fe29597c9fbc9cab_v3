The station is strategically positioned within this river basin to monitor precipitation patterns and support water resource management in the region. While one description identifies the location as the \"Gedangzhai River basin\" and another as the \"Ge Dang Zhai River basin,\" these are consistent references to the same geographic area, with the variation arising only from differences in spacing and romanization. Therefore, both descriptions confirm the station’s location within this specific watershed. As a dedicated rainfall monitoring site, Lanshan Rainfall Station plays a critical role in collecting accurate and timely precipitation data, which is essential for flood forecasting, agricultural planning, and environmental monitoring in the local community. The data gathered at this station contributes to broader meteorological and hydrological networks, supporting regional climate studies and disaster preparedness initiatives.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
