The Dapo Group functions as a distinct subgroup or settlement within the broader administrative and geographic boundaries of Huangni Village. It is an integral part of the village’s social, cultural, and territorial structure, contributing to the overall community framework. As a constituent settlement, the Dapo Group shares the village’s communal resources, governance, and identity while maintaining its own localized characteristics. This hierarchical arrangement reflects common rural organizational patterns in which larger villages are composed of smaller, historically or geographically defined subgroups. Both HUANGNI VILLAGE and the HUANGNI VILLAGE DAPO GROUP are thus interconnected, with the latter operating as a subunit under the umbrella of the former.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
