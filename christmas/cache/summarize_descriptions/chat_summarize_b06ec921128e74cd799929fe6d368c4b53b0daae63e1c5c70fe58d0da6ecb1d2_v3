Flowing in a southeast direction from its source in the northwest, the river traverses key localities including Yitang and Shanmengkou before converging with the Ge Dangzhai River at a location named Wengwei. The river’s total drainage area measures 8.23 km², reflecting its role as a localized but significant hydrological feature within the regional watershed.\n\nThe Wengwei River is documented in technical hydrological studies, specifically appearing as branch 'b' in a water surface profile diagram (Figure 5.3-14), which is likely part of a broader flood modeling or hydraulic analysis framework. This inclusion indicates that the river is subject to engineering or environmental assessments, particularly those concerned with water level behavior, flow dynamics, and flood risk management. Its designation as a labeled branch in such technical diagrams underscores its importance in understanding the overall hydraulic network connected to the Ge Dangzhai River system.\n\nTogether, these descriptions present the Wengwei River as both a geographically defined natural stream and a component of engineered water system analysis. Its physical course and catchment characteristics are well delineated, supporting its use in scientific and technical applications aimed at managing water resources and mitigating flood hazards in the region. Despite minor variations in the river’s name (Ge Dangzhai vs. Gudangzhai), these are interpreted as transliteration differences, with both referring to the same mainstem river into which the Wengwei flows. The Wengwei River thus functions as a minor but integral tributary within a larger fluvial system, contributing to both the hydrology and floodplain management considerations of the area.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
