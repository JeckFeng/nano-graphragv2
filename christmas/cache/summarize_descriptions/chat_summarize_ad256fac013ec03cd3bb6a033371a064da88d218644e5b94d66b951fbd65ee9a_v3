It functions as a comprehensive control section used for hydrological monitoring, primarily focused on water level and flow dynamics throughout the river system. By synthesizing measurements from multiple individual monitoring points, GDZALL enables more accurate and holistic assessments of water surface profiles, facilitating detailed analysis of river behavior under varying hydrological conditions.\n\nEach GDZ-series control section (e.g., GDZ2, GDZ3, etc.) collects localized data on parameters such as water depth, velocity, and discharge, which are then compiled under the GDZALL framework. This aggregation allows engineers and hydrologists to model longitudinal water surface elevations, detect trends, and support flood forecasting, river management, and infrastructure planning. The use of GDZALL as a unified reference point enhances consistency in data interpretation and improves the reliability of simulations involving channel hydraulics.\n\nAlthough the river is referred to interchangeably as the Guangdangzhai and Gedangzhai River in the descriptions, these references pertain to the same watercourse, with GDZALL serving as a standardized composite metric for systematic river analysis. The minor discrepancy in river naming appears to stem from variant romanizations or transcription differences, but both refer to the same geographical entity. Resolving this, the GDZALL system remains anchored to this specific river and its network of monitoring stations.\n\nIn summary, GDZALL represents not a physical location but a data-integration construct that unifies hydrological observations from the GDZ-series control sections. Its primary purpose is to support advanced modeling of water surface profiles along the Guangdangzhai/Gedangzhai River by combining discrete measurements into a coherent, large-scale dataset. This integrated approach ensures robust monitoring and informed decision-making in water resource and environmental management.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 612, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
