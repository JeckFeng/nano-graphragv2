The village comprises multiple village groups, with various sources identifying slightly different compositions, but consistently including Wengwei, Gubin, and Shuiluodong. Other named groups associated with Guyang Village include Wengwei, Qingcai Tang (also recorded as Qingcailong or Taitang), Lugugu, Lujiaqiao, Lujiapu, Gujin, and Dabang. These variations in group names and counts may reflect administrative updates, local naming conventions, or changes over time—such as the renaming of Taitang to Qingcailong—highlighting the dynamic nature of village subdivisions.\n\nThe village is notable for its geographical and infrastructural features. It hosts the Xiniu Tan Reservoir, an important local water resource, and lies in a riverine environment where several engineered structures have been constructed. These include bridges and concrete weirs along the river, indicating efforts to manage water flow and support transportation within the area. Such infrastructure suggests ongoing development and flood or water resource management initiatives, especially given that parts of Guyang Village are classified as dangerous zones.\n\nSpecifically, the village includes five recognized dangerous zones: Lugugu, Shuiluodong, Wengwei, Gujin, and Taitang (Qingcailong). These areas are likely identified as high-risk due to their proximity to water bodies, topographical vulnerability, or structural concerns, necessitating monitoring or mitigation measures.\n\nCollectively, Guyang Village functions as an administratively and geographically significant rural unit within Xingshan Street, integrating residential, infrastructural, and environmental elements. Its patchwork of village groups reflects both the complexity of local governance and the close-knit, decentralized nature of rural settlements in the region. The presence of water management infrastructure and risk zones underscores the interplay between human habitation and natural systems, particularly in a landscape shaped by rivers and reservoirs.\n\nIn summary, Guyang Village is a multi-group settlement in Xingshan Street, Majiang County, composed of Wengwei, Gubin, Shuiluodong, Lugugu, Qingcailong (formerly Taitang), and other associated groups. It is home to the Xiniu Tan Reservoir and various riverine structures such as bridges and weirs, while also encompassing several officially designated dangerous zones, reflecting both its developmental and environmental significance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens": 335, "total_tokens": 842, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
