It serves as a foundational component of L2 and L3 data infrastructure, supporting advanced terrain and hydrological modeling applications. The DEM is generated at a scale of 1:2000 using high-resolution aerial photogrammetry and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, ensuring detailed and accurate depictions of the Earth's surface. These data sources are processed from classified point cloud datasets, which are systematically filtered to represent bare-earth terrain by removing non-ground features such as vegetation and buildings.\n\nTo ensure reliability and precision, the DEM undergoes rigorous multi-level quality checks throughout its production workflow. These validation processes verify the model’s vertical and horizontal accuracy, making it suitable for scientific and engineering applications that require high-fidelity elevation data. The final product is provided in standard geospatial formats, specifically GeoTIFF (*.Geotiff) accompanied by world files (*.tfw) for spatial referencing, enabling seamless integration into geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing platforms.\n\nThe DEM has a spatial resolution of 12.5 meters, balancing detail and computational efficiency for regional-scale analyses. This resolution supports a wide range of applications, particularly in hydrological modeling, where accurate representation of terrain slope, drainage patterns, and watershed boundaries is essential. By capturing elevation variations across landscapes, the DEM enables the simulation of surface water flow, flood risk assessment, erosion modeling, and other environmental processes.\n\nIn Chinese contexts, the model is referred to as 数字高程模型 (Digital Elevation Model), emphasizing its function in expressing surface elevation information for geoscientific research and infrastructure planning. Its standardized format and verified accuracy make it a reliable resource for cross-disciplinary studies, including urban planning, natural resource management, disaster response, and climate change adaptation.\n\nOverall, DEM is a robust, high-quality geospatial dataset derived from advanced remote sensing technologies and stringent quality assurance protocols. It integrates seamlessly into multi-tiered data infrastructures and supports both local and large-scale modeling efforts, serving as an essential tool for understanding and managing Earth's topographic complexity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 730, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
