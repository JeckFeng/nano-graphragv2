It is part of a series of GDZ-named sections along the Gedangzhai River system, used for hydrological monitoring and modeling purposes. The site functions as a control section for measuring the relationship between water level and flow, enabling accurate assessment of hydrological dynamics within the watershed. With a drainage area of 8.23 km², the GDZB4 section lies in a relatively small but significant catchment area that contributes to the overall flow of the Gedangzhai River system. The channel characteristics at this cross-section include a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.05, indicating a moderately rough riverbed, and a channel slope of 11.06‰ (approximately 1.106%), which reflects a moderately steep gradient influencing flow velocity and discharge behavior. These physical parameters are essential inputs for hydraulic and hydrological models used to predict flood events, manage water resources, and assess sediment transport in the region. The designation “GDZB4” aligns with a standardized naming convention for monitoring points in the area, suggesting it is one of several systematically placed cross-sections along the Gedangzhai River and its tributaries. Its placement on the Wengwei River underscores its role in capturing tributary-specific data that contributes to a broader understanding of the main river’s hydrology. As a monitored cross-section, GDZB4 supports ongoing environmental and engineering studies, particularly in regions where accurate water level and discharge measurements are critical for infrastructure planning, ecological assessment, and disaster preparedness. Overall, GDZB4 serves as a vital hydrological observation point, combining precise geographic placement, defined morphological characteristics, and integration into a larger monitoring network to support water resource management in the Gedangzhai River basin.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 700, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
