The village comprises several distinct groups, including Dapo, Xinglong, Tiankan, Mianhua, Huangni, and Xinzhuang, which are recognized both as residential clusters and as survey units within broader environmental or hydrological studies. These groups are integral to field research conducted in the region, with Dapo, Tiankan, and Xinglong frequently cited as key surveyed sub-areas.\n\nThe village is notably situated near significant water bodies and hydrological monitoring sites. It lies adjacent to the Gedangzhai River (also referred to as the Gudangzhai River), where hydrological parameters are actively measured at monitoring section GDZ8. This site contributes to regional water resource assessments and environmental monitoring efforts. Additionally, the Mianhuachong Reservoir is located within the vicinity of Huangni Village, specifically noted as being in the Mianhua group area of Gudong Town, underscoring the village’s importance in local water management infrastructure.\n\nHuangni Village is thus not only a residential and administrative unit but also a focal point for environmental observation. Its location along river systems and the presence of reservoirs highlight its role in watershed management and rural development initiatives in Majiang County. The integration of multiple hamlets into a single administrative or survey entity reflects the collective structure of rural settlements in the region, where community groups function semi-autonomously while contributing to broader territorial planning and data collection.\n\nIn summary, Huangni Village is a multi-group settlement in Majiang County, primarily situated in Gudong Town (with possible ties to Yuntuan or Gutong Town due to overlapping geographical or administrative references), encompassing communities such as Dapo, Xinglong, Tiankan, Mianhua, and Xinzhuang. It hosts the Mianhuachong Reservoir and lies along the Gedangzhai (Gudangzhai) River, where hydrological monitoring occurs at section GDZ8. As a surveyed geographical entity, it plays a significant role in both rural habitation and environmental research in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 473, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 804, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
