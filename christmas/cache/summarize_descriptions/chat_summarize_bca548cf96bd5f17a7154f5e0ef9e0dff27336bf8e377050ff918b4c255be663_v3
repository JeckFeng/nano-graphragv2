During this event, high water levels left visible flood marks (洪痕) near the GDZ46 cross-section, providing physical evidence of the flood’s extent. These marks were later surveyed and recorded at an elevation of 823.59 meters, serving as a key data point for reconstructing the flood’s peak stage. Utilizing these measured high water marks, hydrologists applied Manning's formula to estimate the discharge at the GDZ46 location. The analysis revealed that the peak flow during the 1996 flood was nearly equivalent to the design flood value, indicating an extreme event that approached or matched the theoretical maximum for which infrastructure in the area may have been engineered. The combination of field observations and hydraulic modeling at GDZ46 thus provided critical insights into the magnitude and behavior of the 1996 flood, reinforcing the importance of accurate high water mark documentation and cross-sectional analysis in flood risk assessment. Together, the 1996 flood and the GDZ46 cross-section represent a significant case study in flood hydrology, where empirical evidence and engineering methods converged to validate flood modeling approaches and inform future flood management strategies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
