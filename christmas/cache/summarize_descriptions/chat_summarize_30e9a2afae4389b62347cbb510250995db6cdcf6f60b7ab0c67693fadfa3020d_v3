It serves as a critical reference point for hydrological observations and water surface profile analyses. The cross-section is positioned at a starting distance of 1,562 meters along the river and features a thalweg elevation of 993.934 meters above a defined datum. During measurements, the observed water edge point was recorded at an elevation of 994.466 meters, indicating the vertical position of the river's water level at that location under specific flow conditions. \n\nAs part of hydrological monitoring efforts, GDZ8 is utilized in the calculation of water surface profiles across multiple flood frequency scenarios, including 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% annual exceedance probabilities. These profiles are essential for flood risk assessment, river engineering design, and water resource management in the surrounding region. The data collected at GDZ8 supports modeling of flood extents, inundation mapping, and infrastructure planning, particularly in areas vulnerable to seasonal or extreme flow events.\n\nThe designation of GDZ8 as both a control section and a monitoring cross-section underscores its dual role in both operational river management and scientific data collection. Its location in Huangni Village situates it within a broader network of hydrological monitoring points along the Gedangzhai River, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of river behavior and watershed dynamics. Regular monitoring at this site enables authorities to detect changes in channel morphology, assess flow resistance, and validate hydraulic models under varying discharge conditions.\n\nIn summary, GDZ8 is a strategically important cross-section on the Gedangzhai River in Huangni Village, characterized by a thalweg elevation of 993.934 m and a measured water edge elevation of 994.466 m at a starting distance of 1,562 m. It plays a vital role in hydrological analysis, particularly in the development of water surface profiles for flood frequency assessments ranging from 1% to 20%, supporting flood forecasting, water management, and infrastructure resilience in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 679, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
