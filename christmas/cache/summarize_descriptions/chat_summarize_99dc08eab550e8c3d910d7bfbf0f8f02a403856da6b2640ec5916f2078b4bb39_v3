Gubin Group functions as a constituent hamlet within the administrative and geographical boundaries of Guyang Village. This hierarchical relationship indicates that Gubin Group is not an independent village but rather an integral part of the larger Guyang Village community. Field survey data has been recorded specifically within the Gubin Group, highlighting its significance as a site of research or data collection efforts aimed at understanding the socio-economic, demographic, or environmental conditions of the area. The presence of documented field surveys underscores the role of Gubin Group as a representative or focal point within Guyang Village for observational and empirical studies. Together, the two entities form a cohesive local unit where the hamlet contributes to the broader social and administrative framework of the parent village. This structure is typical of rural settlement patterns in regions where larger villages consist of multiple smaller, named clusters or groups that share common governance, resources, and community identity. Thus, GUBIN GROUP and GUYANG VILLAGE are intrinsically linked, with the former serving both as a residential subdivision and a practical unit for data gathering and local organization within the latter.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
