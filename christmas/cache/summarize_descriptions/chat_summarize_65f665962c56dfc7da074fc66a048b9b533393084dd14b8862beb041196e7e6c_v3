This monitoring site serves as a critical location for measuring water level and flow rate relationships, particularly in the context of flood observation and watershed management. The cross-section is part of a broader hydrological monitoring network within the watershed, designed to support accurate data collection during flood events and to aid in the analysis of river behavior under varying flow conditions.\n\nThe GDZ46 control section encompasses a drainage area of 77.56 km², reflecting its significance in representing hydrological processes over a substantial portion of the catchment. The river channel at this location is characterized by a Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052, indicating moderate channel resistance to flow, which is typical for natural river channels with mixed bed composition and some vegetation. Additionally, the longitudinal slope of the river at GDZ46 is measured at 3.49‰ (approximately 0.349%), contributing to the overall flow velocity and energy gradient of the river system at this confluence point.\n\nIts strategic placement near Xiao Zhai village enhances its utility for local flood forecasting and water resource management, as it captures flow conditions at a key junction—specifically where the Gedangzhai River discharges into the Xibu River. This confluence context makes GDZ46 particularly valuable for understanding cumulative runoff contributions and flood dynamics within the larger river network.\n\nGDZ46 functions both as a monitoring cross-section and a hydraulic control point, enabling consistent and repeatable measurements of water surface elevation and discharge. The data collected at this site support hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, and the calibration of rating curves that define the stage-discharge relationship essential for streamflow estimation. All descriptions consistently emphasize its role in flood-related observations, highlighting its operational importance during high-flow events.\n\nIn summary, GDZ46 is a well-defined, strategically located hydrological monitoring station on the Gedangzhai River at Xiao Zhai, serving as a control section for measuring water levels, flow rates, and flood dynamics. With a drainage area of 77.56 km², a channel roughness of 0.052, and a slope of 3.49‰, it provides essential data for understanding river behavior and managing flood risks in the watershed where the Gedangzhai River meets the Xibu River.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 520, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 789, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
