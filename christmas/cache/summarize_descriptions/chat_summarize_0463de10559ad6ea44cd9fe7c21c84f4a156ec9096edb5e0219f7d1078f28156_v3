It plays a critical role in river cross-sectional surveys, where accurate elevation data of the riverbed is required for hydrological analysis, flood modeling, and environmental monitoring. Typically deployed from boats, the测深杆 is lowered vertically into the water until it makes contact with the riverbed, allowing surveyors to determine the depth at specific points along a river’s cross-section.\n\nThis tool is especially valuable in areas with turbid water, dense vegetation, or other conditions that limit the effectiveness of optical or laser-based measurement systems. Unlike automated or remote sensing methods, the测深杆 provides direct, physical measurement, ensuring high accuracy in localized depth readings. Its simplicity, reliability, and low cost make it a preferred choice for field hydrographers conducting detailed bathymetric studies in inland waterways.\n\nThe data collected using the测深杆 contributes to the creation of precise riverbed topography maps, which are essential for understanding sediment transport, channel morphology, and aquatic habitat structure. While the method is labor-intensive and slower compared to modern scanning technologies, its use remains indispensable in environments where technological alternatives fall short. As such, the测深杆 continues to be a fundamental tool in fluvial geomorphology and water resource management, complementing more advanced surveying techniques by filling critical data gaps. Its application underscores the importance of combining traditional field methods with modern technology to achieve comprehensive and accurate hydrographic assessments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
