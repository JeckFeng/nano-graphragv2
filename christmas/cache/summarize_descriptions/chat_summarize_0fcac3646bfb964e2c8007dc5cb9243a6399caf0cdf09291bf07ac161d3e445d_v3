Daping Village is composed of several such groups, with Lantang Group being one of the recognized subdivisions where residents are formally listed. The identification of Chen Guozhong within both the broader Daping Village and the more specific Lantang Group reflects the hierarchical administrative structure commonly used in rural Chinese communities, where villages are divided into smaller groups for organizational and governance purposes. This dual listing does not indicate contradiction but rather provides increasingly precise locational detail about Chen Guozhong’s residence. Therefore, Chen Guozhong resides in Lantang Group, Daping Village, with this information consistent across official or community records.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
