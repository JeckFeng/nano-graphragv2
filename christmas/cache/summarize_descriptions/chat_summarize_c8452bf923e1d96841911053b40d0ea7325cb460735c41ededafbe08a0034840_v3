This site is situated within a watershed area of 5.98 km² and features a channel slope of 9.94‰, making it a significant location for hydrological modeling and analysis. While one description references GDZA4X in relation to the Gedangzhai River, further contextual detail confirms its precise location on the Gulbin Stream, which may be part of the broader Gedangzhai River system. This alignment suggests that GDZA4X serves as a critical reference point within the river network, particularly for water surface profile calculations and flood routing studies.\n\nThe control section plays an essential role in hydrological assessments, providing key data for understanding flow behavior, water surface elevations, and drainage characteristics in the region. Its placement at Shuiluodong—a defined geographic and hydrological node—enables accurate monitoring and simulation of runoff dynamics within the 5.98 km² catchment. The relatively steep channel slope of 9.94‰ indicates a terrain with significant gradient, contributing to rapid water conveyance and potentially high flow velocities during precipitation events. This characteristic is crucial for flood risk evaluation and watershed management planning.\n\nIn practice, GDZA4X is used in technical hydrological analyses, including the computation of water surface profiles under various flow scenarios. These profiles are essential for designing hydraulic structures, assessing floodplain extents, and ensuring compliance with water resource regulations. The integration of GDZA4X into such models underscores its importance as a calibrated and referenced control point, ensuring consistency and accuracy in regional water studies.\n\nDespite initial ambiguity in naming—referencing both the Gulbin Stream and the Gedangzhai River—the data converge on a single, coherent interpretation: GDZA4X is a defined control section on the Gulbin Stream (a tributary within the Gedangzhai River basin), utilized for precise hydrological computations. Its watershed characteristics, geographic specificity, and morphometric parameters collectively support its role in scientific and engineering applications related to water resource management in the area.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 442, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
