INERTIAL EXPLORER is primarily responsible for processing and solving navigation data derived from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to determine precise aircraft position and orientation (POS data). This high-accuracy trajectory solution is essential for correcting raw sensor data and ensuring georeferencing precision. Once the navigation data has been accurately solved, it is exported and subsequently imported into TERRASOLID, a specialized software suite designed for processing LiDAR point clouds.\n\nThe integration between INERTIAL EXPLORER and TERRASOLID enables a seamless workflow where the corrected POS data from INERTIAL EXPLORER is applied to the raw LiDAR point cloud data within TERRASOLID. This step, known as point cloud georeferencing, aligns the laser scan data with real-world coordinates, forming the foundation for detailed terrain modeling, feature extraction, and 3D visualization. The processed data from INERTIAL EXPLORER thus serves as a critical input for TERRASOLID, ensuring the spatial accuracy required for applications such as topographic mapping, forestry analysis, powerline inspection, and urban planning.\n\nThis sequential use of INERTIAL EXPLORER followed by TERRASOLID constitutes a standardized pipeline in airborne LiDAR data processing, where each software performs a specialized role. The workflow begins with inertial and GNSS data processing in INERTIAL EXPLORER, culminating in the generation of accurate trajectory files. These files are then used in TERRASOLID to refine and classify point cloud datasets, enabling advanced terrain modeling and feature classification. The statement that “Inertial Explorer 解算后的数据导入 Terrasolid 进行后续点云处理，构成数据处理流程的衔接” further emphasizes the interoperability and dependency between the two tools, confirming that the output from INERTIAL EXPLORER is directly utilized in TERRASOLID to ensure continuity and precision in geospatial analysis.\n\nIn summary, INERTIAL EXPLORER and TERRASOLID function synergistically in a structured data processing chain: INERTIAL EXPLORER ensures accurate positioning and orientation solutions, which are then leveraged by TERRASOLID to process, classify, and model LiDAR point clouds with high spatial fidelity. Their combined use supports robust, end-to-end processing of airborne geospatial data, making them essential tools in modern surveying and remote sensing applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 540, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
