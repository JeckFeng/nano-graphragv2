The village serves as an important geographical and administrative unit comprising multiple smaller residential groups, including Dabang, Gu Bin (also recorded as Gubin), Shuiluodong, Wengwei, Qingcayang, Lugu, and Lujiaqiao. These subgroups form the constituent communities of Guyang Village, contributing to its socio-geographical structure and significance in regional studies.\n\nThe village is situated in close proximity to the Xiunitan Reservoir, indicating its relevance in local water resource systems and landscape management. Additionally, Guyang Village features several river infrastructure elements such as concrete weirs and multiple river bridges, suggesting both the hydrological complexity of the area and the engineering efforts to manage water flow and transportation within the settlement.\n\nDue to its structural composition and geographical features, Guyang Village has become a focal point for field survey activities and data collection. Multiple research or survey groups—including the Dabang Group, Gu Bin Group, Shuiluodong, and Wengwei Group—have been documented as operational units within the village, reflecting organized efforts to study environmental, social, or developmental aspects of the region. The repeated emphasis on field surveys highlights Guyang Village’s role as a key site for empirical research, possibly related to rural development, water management, or ecological assessment.\n\nWhile variations exist in the recorded names of groups and administrative divisions—such as discrepancies in the spelling of Majiang/Magang County and the inclusion or exclusion of certain subgroups—the overall pattern confirms Guyang Village as a multi-group settlement with both infrastructural and environmental significance. The integration of residential clusters, water management structures, and research activity underscores its multifaceted role in the local landscape.\n\nIn summary, Guyang Village is a geographically and administratively structured rural settlement in Xingshan Subdistrict, Majiang County, composed of several residential groups and situated near the Xiunitan Reservoir. It is characterized by river infrastructure such as bridges and concrete weirs and has served as a central location for organized field surveys across its constituent subgroups, making it a key site for data collection and rural study in the region.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 464, "prompt_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
