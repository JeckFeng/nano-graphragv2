Situated within this ecologically and hydrologically significant region, the station plays a crucial role in collecting accurate and timely precipitation data to support water resource management, flood forecasting, and environmental monitoring efforts. The slight variation in the basin’s name—“Ge Dang Zhai” versus “Gedangzhai”—reflects differences in transliteration from Chinese to English, with both referring to the same geographical area. As part of a broader network of meteorological and hydrological observation points, BAISHA RAINFALL STATION contributes vital data for regional climate studies and disaster prevention initiatives. Its strategic placement within the river basin enables it to monitor rainfall patterns that directly influence river flow, agricultural planning, and ecosystem health in the surrounding region. The station exemplifies the integration of environmental monitoring infrastructure in rural and semi-rural basins to enhance resilience against weather-related hazards and support sustainable development.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
