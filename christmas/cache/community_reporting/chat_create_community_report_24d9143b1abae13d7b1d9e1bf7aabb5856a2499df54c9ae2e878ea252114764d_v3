It is constructed on a first-order tributary of the Dangzhai River, specifically the 小坝河, and serves a critical role in irrigation for the surrounding area. The reservoir’s design and operational characteristics are defined by multiple technical parameters such as storage capacity, dam structure, and water levels, all of which contribute to its function in regional water resource management. Its central position is reinforced by its high degree (19) in the network and numerous relationships with key technical attributes.

The 正常库容 is 87,600 m³, representing the volume of water stored at the normal operating level. The 死库容, at 6,900 m³, refers to the volume of water that cannot be drained by gravity and remains at the lowest operational level. The 总库容, 124,000 m³, indicates the maximum water volume the reservoir can hold. These metrics are essential for managing water availability for irrigation and ensuring structural safety.

However, the 实际灌溉面积 is reported as 260 mu, which may suggest underperformance in water delivery or land use changes. Notably, the data source indicates potential confusion in the text, as the 260 mu figure might pertain to another reservoir, raising concerns about data accuracy or misattribution in reporting. This discrepancy, if valid, could indicate inefficiencies in water distribution or infrastructure limitations. Clarification is needed to determine whether the lower irrigation coverage is due to operational failures, siltation, or external factors such as drought or land conversion.

These specifications are crucial for assessing the dam’s stability, flood capacity, and safety under extreme conditions. The auxiliary dam being a homogeneous earthfill structure suggests traditional construction methods suitable for small-scale water retention. These metrics are directly linked to the reservoir’s ability to safely store and regulate water flow.
