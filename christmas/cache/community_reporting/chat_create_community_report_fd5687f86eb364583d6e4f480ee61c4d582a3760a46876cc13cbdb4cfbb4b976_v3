Its location on a left-bank first-order tributary of the Gedangzhai River establishes a direct hydrological connection to the broader Zhonganjiang River system, influencing downstream water availability and flood risk. The reservoir has a total storage capacity of 107,000 m³, which, while modest, is critical for sustaining agricultural output in the immediate area. Its placement within the Gedangzhai River watershed underscores its role in regional water management and ecological continuity.

It is part of the Gedangzhai River watershed, linking it hydrologically to the broader river system. Monitoring data for the reservoir is collected via the Xiaoba rainfall station, indicating an established system for tracking precipitation and potentially informing water release and flood control decisions. This integration of monitoring infrastructure highlights a level of technical oversight necessary for safe and effective reservoir operations.

It features a homogeneous earth dam and a normal storage level corresponding to 471,000 m³, making it significantly larger in volume than Mayitang Reservoir. Its location on a right-bank first-order tributary of the Gedangzhai River places it within the same watershed, contributing to cumulative hydrological effects during rainfall events.

Its authority is exercised in coordination with the County Water Affairs Bureau, which provides technical guidance and supervision. The government's management duties include ensuring safe dam operations, efficient water distribution for irrigation, and compliance with regional water policies.

This interconnectedness means that cumulative water releases, rainfall, or dam failures could have compounding effects downstream. The watershed-wide perspective is essential for flood forecasting, drought response, and environmental protection.
