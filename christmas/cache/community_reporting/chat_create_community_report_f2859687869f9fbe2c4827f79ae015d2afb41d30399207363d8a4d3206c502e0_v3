These subgroups function as distinct residential and administrative clusters under the overarching governance of Guyang Village. Each subgroup maintains its own demographic records, such as household and population counts, indicating a formalized structure for local administration. The presence of multiple field surveys across these subgroups highlights their role in data-driven rural development initiatives. The integration of these hamlets into a unified administrative framework enables coordinated resource management, planning, and research activities. This hierarchical organization is typical of rural governance systems in China, where larger villages aggregate smaller settlements for administrative efficiency. The degree centrality of Guyang Village (23) underscores its role as the central node connecting all subgroups and associated actors.

These numbers are sometimes split into numeric components in datasets, likely due to data entry practices in survey systems. Their repeated listing as contacts across different groups (e.g., Wengwei Group) suggests formal or informal leadership roles in organizing field activities or disseminating information. Notably, Wang Yingqing and Yu Zaitao are both linked to Wengwei Group, indicating overlapping responsibilities or collaborative engagement in data collection efforts. The convergence of contact data, geographic specificity, and functional roles supports the conclusion that these individuals are central to the operational workflow of field surveys. No contradictory information exists about their identities, and minor spelling variations (e.g., 'Goyang' instead of 'Guyang') are consistent with transcription errors rather than separate entities.

This application enabled survey teams to record, update, and integrate environmental and infrastructure data more efficiently, improving accuracy and coordination with technical teams. The use of digital tools in rural fieldwork indicates a modernization of data collection methods, aligning local efforts with broader technological standards in environmental monitoring. The app was specifically used during surveys that included cross-sectional measurements and photographic documentation, especially in subgroups like Wengwei and Gubin. The structured format of identifiers (e.g., segmented phone numbers) suggests integration with digital forms or databases, further supporting the app’s role in systematic data entry. Wang Yingqing is likely among the users of this app, given the alignment of identifier formats with those used in the application. The deployment of such technology reflects a commitment to data integrity and long-term monitoring capabilities in rural governance.

These structures play vital roles in flood control, irrigation, and riverine transportation, with documented coordinates and technical specifications such as water-blocking area ratios. For instance, Gedangzhai River Bridge 02 has a water-blocking area ratio of 43.12%, indicating significant obstruction to river flow, which may require monitoring for sedimentation or flooding risks. The weirs are classified as type C obstructions, a categorization likely tied to regional hydraulic engineering standards. These infrastructures are embedded within the natural landscape along the Gudangzhai River and are integral to both ecological and agricultural systems in the area. Their inclusion in field surveys underscores the importance of maintaining infrastructure resilience and environmental balance. The data collected supports watershed management and long-term planning by local authorities, particularly in assessing erosion and hydrological changes.

As a subdistrict, it functions as a local governance unit that implements county-level policies while managing rural development, infrastructure, and public services. The street administration oversees the maintenance of critical structures such as river bridges and concrete weirs, ensuring their functionality and safety. Its administrative role includes facilitating field surveys and supporting data collection initiatives that inform regional planning. The designation of Xingshan Street as both a township-level division and an administrative subdistrict reflects the hybrid governance models found in transitional rural-urban zones in China. This dual status enables more responsive and localized administration, particularly in areas undergoing development or environmental monitoring. The relationship between Xingshan Street and Magang County (via Guding Town) situates Guyang Village within a broader administrative hierarchy, ensuring alignment with higher-level planning and regulatory frameworks.

Field surveys in Wengwei have included photographic documentation and observational data collection, contributing to broader research on rural environmental conditions. As one of the most frequently referenced subgroups in survey records, Wengwei Group exemplifies the integration of local settlements into scientific data networks. The presence of multiple contacts—Wang Yingqing, Yu Zaitao, and Bao Chengyun—further emphasizes its operational importance in coordinating fieldwork. Its geographic location along a major river likely influences local land use patterns, agriculture, and flood risk, making it a representative case for studying human-environment interactions in rural China. The repeated inclusion of Wengwei in datasets highlights its role as both a residential community and a node in environmental monitoring systems.
