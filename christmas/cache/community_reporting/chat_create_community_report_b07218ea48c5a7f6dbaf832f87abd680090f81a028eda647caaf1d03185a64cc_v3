The project spans from 2025/8/27 to 2028/8/28 and involves advanced UAV-based methods such as oblique photography and LiDAR data acquisition for 3D reconstruction of a small watershed area. Its scope suggests it supports long-term environmental or geographic analysis, likely for governmental or scientific purposes. The integration of multiple data streams—oblique imagery, LiDAR, and 720-degree panoramic data—demonstrates a comprehensive approach to 3D modeling.

This standardization ensures consistency, accuracy, and interoperability of the 3D models produced, aligning the project with nationally recognized best practices. Being compliant with an official technical specification enhances the credibility and potential usability of the collected data across agencies or platforms. The linkage between the project and this regulation underscores a formalized, regulated approach to geospatial data collection, minimizing methodological deviations.

This technique enhances the 3D models by providing real-world visual context, aiding in validation, interpretation, and integration of aerial data. Ground-level panoramic imaging helps bridge the gap between aerial reconstructions and on-site conditions, improving model accuracy and utility for field applications. The data was collected specifically within the watershed area, indicating targeted efforts to enrich spatial data with environmental details.
