Located in Guizhou Province, the river forms part of the Chong’an River 001 Basin, which is officially classified under the Dongting Lake drainage framework, indicating its role in regional water management despite geographic distance from the lake itself. This classification reflects China’s integrated approach to watershed governance, where river basins are administratively linked based on hydrological connectivity rather than proximity alone. The river feeds into the larger Dongting Lake water system, which plays a vital role in regulating the Yangtze River’s flow and mitigating flood risks downstream. Its inclusion in scientific studies related to rainfall-induced inundation and flood modeling underscores its environmental significance. Research efforts focus on improving early warning systems and disaster preparedness, particularly in vulnerable downstream communities.

It flows through high-risk flood zones, including Wengwei Group and Taitang Group, both located in Xingshan Town, and serves as a focal point for environmental monitoring and flood risk assessment. Multiple hydrological cross-sections have been established along its course, including GDZ30 at Taitang Group and GDZ28 and GDZb4 near Wengwei Group, to measure water levels, rainfall intensity, and potential inundation under various flood scenarios. These monitoring points are integral to predictive modeling and early warning systems designed to protect small rural communities. The river’s connection to both administrative and scientific frameworks highlights its importance in local governance and disaster resilience planning. The presence of such infrastructure reflects a proactive approach to managing hydrological risks in a region prone to seasonal flooding and extreme weather events.

Due to its low-lying location and proximity to active river channels, it has been officially designated as a high-risk flood danger zone. Hydrological assessments have evaluated its vulnerability under 1% (100-year) and 2% (50-year) annual chance flood events, both of which indicate significant threats to life and property. Real-time monitoring at cross-section GDZb4 on the Gendang Zhaihe River provides critical data for rainfall-based early warning systems, enabling timely evacuation orders when thresholds are exceeded. The Wengwei River, locally considered a main stem despite being a tributary (designated GDZb), further amplifies the area’s exposure. A bridge constructed over the river supports local connectivity but also underscores the settlement’s dependency on vulnerable infrastructure. Despite minor naming discrepancies in river references, spatial and administrative data confirm the area’s consistent identification in flood risk databases.

Comprising 6 households and 25 residents, the group was previously known as Qingcaitang Group and fell under close scrutiny for potential inundation. However, recent hydrological reassessments have concluded that the area does not face significant flood risk, leading to its formal reclassification and removal from danger zone status. This change reflects improved modeling techniques, better topographic understanding, and updated environmental data, illustrating how scientific advancements can refine disaster risk management. The site remains important for environmental monitoring, particularly as it corresponds to hydrological cross-section GDZ30, used for flood design and water level analysis. Its transformation from a high-risk to a low-risk area exemplifies effective integration of scientific research into public safety policy and rural development planning.

It also encompasses Yangchangpo Village and Gubin Village, which function as environmental survey points for watershed assessments. As part of Guizhou Province’s rural governance structure, Xingshan Town plays a pivotal role in implementing disaster preparedness initiatives, managing early warning systems, and coordinating flood response efforts. Its location within a complex river network necessitates close collaboration between local authorities and hydrological researchers to ensure community safety. The town’s integration of administrative, environmental, and infrastructural functions makes it a model for integrated flood resilience in rural China.

Similarly, GDZb4 monitors the Wengwei River, a tributary of the Gendang Zhaihe, and supports rainfall warning indicators that trigger evacuation procedures in Wengwei Group. These cross-sections enable precise measurement of water levels, flow rates, and inundation potential under varying flood return periods. The data collected is used in predictive modeling, helping authorities anticipate flood events and mitigate impacts on vulnerable populations.

This classification ensures coordinated management of water resources across provincial boundaries, particularly for flood control, ecological protection, and agricultural sustainability. The system absorbs excess flow from tributaries during monsoon seasons and supports biodiversity and fisheries, making it a cornerstone of regional environmental policy. Rivers like the Gudangzhai and Gendang Zhaihe contribute indirectly to this system, reinforcing the need for holistic watershed planning.
