The relationship between GDZB4 and Wengguo Group is defined by their shared geographic location within the Wengwei River catchment, suggesting potential interdependence in water resource management and disaster preparedness.

Its primary function is to support water surface profile calculations, flood modeling, and watershed-level water flow analysis across an 8.23 km² drainage area. The steep channel slope of 11.06‰ significantly influences water velocity and flood potential, making GDZB4 an essential reference for engineering studies, environmental assessments, and disaster prevention strategies in the region. Data from GDZB4 likely informs infrastructure development and emergency planning, particularly in areas prone to flash flooding due to the terrain's incline. The precise identification of GDZB4 on the Wengwei River—rather than directly on the Ge'dangzhai River—clarifies its position within a nested river system, emphasizing its role in monitoring tributary contributions to the larger basin. This makes GDZB4 a vital node for understanding localized hydrological behavior and its broader implications for watershed management.

This gradient contributes to rapid water movement, increasing the risk of flash floods and erosion, particularly during heavy rainfall events. The hydrological dynamics in this area necessitate accurate monitoring and modeling, for which GDZB4 provides critical data. The area's mountainous or sloped terrain amplifies the importance of precise water flow measurements, as downstream communities—including potentially Wengguo Group—may be vulnerable to sudden changes in river levels. This watershed likely plays a role in regional drainage patterns feeding into the Ge'dangzhai River system, which further underscores the importance of GDZB4 in basin-wide water resource planning. Understanding the behavior of tributaries like the Wengwei River is essential for comprehensive flood forecasting and land use planning in the region.

The description notes that Wengwei Group (likely a typographical variant of Wengguo Group) is the settlement associated with the GDZB4 control section, suggesting that the community resides within or near the monitored watershed. This spatial relationship implies that activities, vulnerabilities, or risks detected at GDZB4—such as rising water levels or flood warnings—could directly affect Wengguo Group. Conversely, land use, deforestation, or construction in Wengguo Group could influence runoff patterns and sediment load in the Wengwei River, potentially impacting the accuracy or relevance of data collected at GDZB4. While no specific socio-economic or infrastructural details about Wengguo Group are provided, its inclusion as a named entity linked to a hydrological control point highlights its potential exposure to water-related hazards.

The data collected at this control section supports engineering studies and infrastructure planning aimed at mitigating hydrological hazards. In mountainous or sloped regions, even moderate rainfall can lead to swift and dangerous increases in river levels, making early warning systems dependent on accurate, real-time monitoring. GDZB4’s measurements contribute to predictive models that can alert nearby communities—such as Wengguo Group—of potential flooding, allowing for timely evacuations or protective measures. Additionally, long-term data from GDZB4 may inform the design of drainage systems, retention basins, or riverbank reinforcements to reduce vulnerability. The control section therefore serves not only a scientific purpose but also a public safety function, particularly in rural or underserved areas where disaster response capacity may be limited.

By providing accurate flow and surface profile data, GDZB4 enables authorities to assess water availability, sediment transport, and ecological health within the Wengwei River sub-watershed. This information is crucial for sustainable land and water use planning, especially in areas where agriculture, settlement expansion, or infrastructure development may stress natural systems. Environmental assessments relying on GDZB4 data could identify degradation trends, pollution sources, or habitat disruptions, guiding conservation or restoration efforts. Furthermore, as climate variability increases the frequency of extreme weather events, the role of monitoring stations like GDZB4 becomes even more critical in building resilience. The integration of such data into regional planning frameworks ensures that development projects do not inadvertently exacerbate flood risks or ecological damage.
