This entity is interconnected with key features such as tributaries (支流), control structures like weirs and dams (堰坝), the overall river network (河网水系), and data delivery formats (KML 或 DWG 格式). These relationships reflect a structured approach to hydraulic analysis, where cross-sectional and longitudinal profiling supports engineering and environmental assessments. The integration of GIS-compatible output standards underscores the technical precision and practical application of the survey data.\",\n    \"rating\": 6.8,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the critical role of cross-sectional layout in hydrological and engineering analyses, which can influence environmental management and infrastructure planning.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Central role of 断面布置 in hydrological analysis\",\n            \"explanation\": \"断面布置 (cross-sectional layout) serves as the central entity in this community, forming the foundation for hydrological and hydraulic assessments within the watershed. It is directly linked to multiple physical and technical components, including tributaries, control structures, and data delivery standards. The high degree centrality (degree = 5) and multiple incoming relationships indicate its pivotal function in structuring survey efforts. This layout determines where longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles are established, which are essential for modeling water flow, sediment transport, and flood risk.

This requirement ensures comprehensive data collection across the entire drainage system, enabling accurate modeling of flow dynamics and water distribution. The mandatory nature of these measurements reflects standardized surveying protocols aimed at consistency and reliability. The relationship between tributaries and cross-sectional layout is fundamental to capturing spatial variability in channel morphology.

These structures create backwater effects, flow convergence, and potential sedimentation zones, all of which must be quantified for accurate modeling. The need for enhanced data collection around such features highlights the integration of engineering considerations into survey design. This practice supports both operational management and environmental impact assessments.

This spatial analysis ensures that key hydrological units—such as confluences, bends, and transitions in slope or substrate—are adequately sampled. The relationship between the river network and cross-sectional layout reflects a strategic, data-driven approach to survey planning, maximizing the utility of collected data while minimizing redundancy. This foundational step is essential for creating accurate digital elevation models and hydraulic simulations.
