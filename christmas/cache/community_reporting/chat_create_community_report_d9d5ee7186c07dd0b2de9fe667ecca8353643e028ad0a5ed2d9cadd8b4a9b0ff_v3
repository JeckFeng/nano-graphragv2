His responsibilities encompass administrative functions, personnel transfers, and ongoing monitoring, positioning him as a central node in the village's governance structure. The consistency of his name and phone number (15286394906) across multiple records confirms his established and reliable role within the system. This centralization suggests that LIU YONG plays a critical role in ensuring operational continuity and information dissemination throughout the community. Disruptions or changes in his position could significantly affect administrative efficiency across the village units.

Each of these hamlets maintains its own population and household counts, suggesting a decentralized demographic structure while remaining administratively integrated under a unified governance framework. These units likely represent distinct residential clusters or kinship-based communities within the broader village. Their classification as sub-units indicates a tiered administrative system where local affairs may be managed at the hamlet level but coordinated centrally through figures like LIU YONG. This structure supports both localized management and centralized oversight, enhancing administrative scalability.

These connections are documented in the data as contact and coordination roles, reinforcing his function as a unifying administrative figure across the entire village. The equal degree of association (degree 5) with each group suggests a balanced and systematic approach to oversight, rather than preferential engagement with any single unit. This widespread connectivity positions LIU YONG as a critical information conduit, potentially controlling or mediating data flow between individual hamlets and higher-level authorities.

This high degree reflects his involvement with multiple organizational units and underscores his role as a central hub in the administrative network. Such centrality implies that LIU YONG is likely responsible for synchronizing activities, relaying directives, and reporting back on local conditions. In network analysis terms, this makes him a high-value node whose influence extends across the full scope of the village’s operational units. His position could be instrumental in both routine governance and in times of crisis response or policy implementation.

Each hamlet follows the same pattern of designating a central point of contact, suggesting a formalized system of accountability and reporting. This standardization enhances administrative reliability and reduces the risk of miscommunication or oversight gaps between units. It also implies the presence of a broader administrative framework or authority above the village level that enforces consistent practices. The repetition of LIU YONG’s name and contact details in identical roles across different groups further supports the idea of a structured, top-down governance model.
