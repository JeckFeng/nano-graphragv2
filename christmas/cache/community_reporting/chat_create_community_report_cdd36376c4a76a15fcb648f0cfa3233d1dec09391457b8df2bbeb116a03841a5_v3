GDZB4 is located on the Wengbei River (also known as Wengwei River), a tributary of the Ge Dang Zhai River, and contributes to overall watershed hydrology assessments [Data: Relationships (524, 525)]. GDZA4X, located on Gubin Stream—another tributary—provides essential data for flood modeling in the upper watershed [Data: Relationships (526)]. Both control sections are integral to downstream analyses, including water surface profiling and flood inundation mapping, making them pivotal in understanding flood dynamics and river behavior under various flow frequencies [Data: Entities (393, 400); Relationships (555, 559)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"水面线 (Water Surface Profile) as a central analytical component\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 水面线 (water surface profile) is a core analytical output in this community, representing the elevation of the water surface along the river under different flow conditions and frequencies.

Additionally, aggregated data from GDZALL, which summarizes overall river behavior, is also used in these calculations, enhancing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the model [Data: Relationships (558)]. The water surface profile is essential for predicting flood extents, designing flood protection infrastructure, and informing emergency planning, highlighting its strategic importance within the hydrological assessment framework [Data: Entities (421, 414, 415); Relationships (558, 559, 555)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"洪水淹没范围分析 (Flood Inundation Extent Analysis) supports risk assessment\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 洪水淹没范围分析 (flood inundation extent analysis) is a critical study phase focused on determining the spatial extent of potential flooding under various frequency scenarios across the watershed.

By integrating these measurements with topographical and hydrological models, analysts can simulate flood propagation and identify vulnerable areas. This capability is vital for urban planning, emergency response, and infrastructure resilience, particularly in regions prone to seasonal flooding or extreme weather events [Data: Entities (416, 413); Relationships (553)].
