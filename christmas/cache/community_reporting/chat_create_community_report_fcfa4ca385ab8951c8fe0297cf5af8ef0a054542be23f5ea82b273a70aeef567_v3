These structures, located primarily in Guyang Village within Xingshan Street, influence water flow, flood risk, and irrigation capacity. The river is monitored through designated control sections for flood modeling, and its interaction with infrastructure contributes to water impoundment and obstruction, affecting nearby settlements.

It flows through multiple villages, including Gudong, Mangya, Huangni, and Gedangzhai, and passes through areas with significant human settlement. Its course and floodplain dynamics directly influence the safety and development of these communities, particularly during periods of high rainfall. The river is integrated into a formal hydrological monitoring system, with control sections labeled GDZ2 through GDZ9 used for water surface line calculations and flood frequency analysis. These analyses are essential for assessing flood risks and implementing preventive measures. The presence of engineered structures such as dams and bridges further alters the river's natural flow, increasing the need for accurate modeling and management. Due to its role in regional water systems and its proximity to populated areas, the Gedangzhai River is central to both environmental planning and disaster preparedness in Majiang County.

These structures are designed to impound water, support irrigation, and mitigate seasonal fluctuations, ensuring a stable water supply for agricultural and domestic use. Their placement in Xingshan Street, particularly within Guyang Village, indicates a coordinated infrastructure development plan aimed at improving water management in the region. The dams' structural dimensions, especially their width and depth, enhance their capacity to control discharge and reduce downstream flood risks during heavy precipitation events. However, by obstructing natural flow, they may also contribute to localized water buildup, increasing the potential for overtopping or structural failure under extreme conditions. The sequential numbering (01, 03, 05) suggests phased construction, reflecting ongoing investment in resilient water systems tailored to local topography and climate. These dams are therefore critical components of regional water security and rural development.

GE DANG ZHAI RIVER BRIDGE 02, for example, has a documented阻水面积比 (water-blocking area ratio) of 43.12%, indicating that nearly half of the river’s cross-sectional area at that point is obstructed by the bridge structure. Such a high obstruction ratio can lead to backwater effects, raising upstream water levels during floods and increasing inundation risks for nearby settlements. Similarly, the concrete weir dams, while serving beneficial functions, also impound water and may delay flood wave propagation, exacerbating downstream flooding if not properly managed. These engineered obstructions necessitate precise hydrological modeling to predict and mitigate flood impacts. The cumulative effect of multiple structures along the river means that even moderate rainfall events could lead to significant water level increases, particularly in constrained sections. Therefore, continuous monitoring and maintenance of these structures are essential to prevent unintended hydrological consequences.

These sections enable engineers and planners to conduct water surface line calculations, which are fundamental to flood frequency analysis and risk mapping. By analyzing data from these points, authorities can model various flood scenarios, estimate return periods, and develop floodplain zoning strategies. This information is crucial for guiding land use planning and infrastructure development in vulnerable areas. The emphasis on such technical modeling reflects the recognized flood hazard associated with the river, particularly given its passage through populated villages and the presence of flow-altering infrastructure. The data collected from these control sections also informs early warning systems and emergency response protocols. As such, the monitoring framework represents a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction, aiming to protect communities in the active floodplain while allowing for sustainable development in safer zones.

This includes CONCRETE WEIR DAM 01, 03, and 05, as well as GE DANG ZHAI RIVER BRIDGE 01 and 02. The clustering of critical water management assets in this specific locality highlights its strategic importance in regional hydrology. The repeated association of these entities with Xingshan Street in the relationship data underscores the role of local governance in maintaining and operating these structures. This geographic concentration means that any failure or malfunction in one component could have cascading effects on the entire system, potentially disrupting water supply, increasing flood risks, or damaging transportation links. Consequently, Xingshan Street’s authorities play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and functionality of this infrastructure network. The area’s development trajectory is thus closely tied to the performance and maintenance of these engineered systems.
