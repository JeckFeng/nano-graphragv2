This flood scenario serves as the foundational risk driver for the entire community, shaping the design and operational requirements of all associated entities, including emergency response teams and supply chains. The high degree of connectivity (degree: 3) and its direct relationships with物资保障 underscore its pivotal role in defining preparedness standards.
