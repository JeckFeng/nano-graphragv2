Its location near rivers increases its vulnerability to hydrological hazards, necessitating targeted flood protection measures. The relationship between 城集镇 and 危险区范围 indicates that this urban settlement is situated within a formally designated mountain flood hazard zone, which elevates its risk profile and underscores the importance of early warning systems and evacuation planning. As an urban center, the presence of dense populations and infrastructure amplifies the potential consequences of flood events.

Their proximity to flowing water bodies makes them inherently susceptible to flash floods and debris flows, common in mountainous terrain during heavy rainfall. The data confirms that these villages are typically located within the 危险区范围 (hazard zone), indicating a formal recognition of their exposure. Rural settlements often have fewer resources for disaster resilience, making them particularly vulnerable.

Additionally, the direct relationship between 保护对象 and 企业事业单位 (enterprises and public institutions) explicitly extends the scope of protection beyond residential areas to include economic and administrative infrastructure.
