This represents over 60% of all designated risk mitigation zones, underscoring its disproportionate vulnerability and strategic importance in regional disaster planning. The identification of these 11 zones as newly recognized hazard areas during field surveys highlights an evolving understanding of flood risks, necessitating immediate infrastructure upgrades, monitoring systems, and community preparedness programs. The town's role is central not only in terms of geographic concentration but also in administrative responsibility for implementing early warning systems and evacuation protocols.

This comprehensive field survey served as the basis for classifying these zones as newly recognized dangers, thereby triggering targeted mitigation actions. By encompassing both Gutong Town and Xingshan Street, the survey provides a regional perspective on flood risk, enabling coordinated planning across administrative boundaries. The data collected supports modeling, emergency response planning, and public awareness initiatives aimed at reducing potential loss of life and property. Its findings directly inform the allocation of resources and prioritization of infrastructure projects in high-risk communities.

These sharp bends disrupt natural flow patterns, leading to localized erosion, sediment buildup, and overflow into adjacent populated areas. Their presence contributes to the town’s elevated risk profile and complicates flood control engineering efforts. Mitigation strategies may require channel modification, reinforcement of riverbanks, or construction of flow diversion structures to reduce peak flood velocities. The co-occurrence of these features with designated prevention targets suggests they are integral to the hazard assessments conducted during the flood risk survey.

This layered vulnerability increases the complexity of disaster response planning, as simultaneous or cascading events may overwhelm local emergency systems. The presence of this hazard suggests underlying geological instability, which may be exacerbated by increased runoff from upstream areas or changes in land use. Given that Dapu Group falls under the jurisdiction of Gutong Town, its risk status is factored into the broader flood prevention strategy, necessitating integrated geotechnical and hydrological monitoring.

As a segment of the larger Dongting Lake system, it serves as the main conduit for floodwaters that threaten Gutong Town and surrounding areas. The river's behavior during storm events directly influences the severity of flash flooding, particularly in zones with sharp channel bends or downstream settlements like Dapu Group. Data on its flow dynamics, cross-sectional profiles, and 3D modeling are critical for accurate flood prediction and infrastructure planning. The integration of this data into the L3 DATA FOUNDATION enhances the technical capacity for real-time monitoring and scenario modeling.

This data foundation enables precise mapping of river cross-sections, elevation changes, and urban-rural land interfaces, allowing for accurate simulation of flood propagation under various rainfall scenarios. Such modeling is essential for designing effective early warning systems, determining evacuation zones, and planning structural interventions like levees or retention basins. The inclusion of the Chongan River and its associated features ensures that the most vulnerable areas, such as Gutong Town, are represented with high fidelity in predictive models.
