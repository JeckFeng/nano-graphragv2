Its inclusion in the flood prevention list highlights its exposure to environmental hazards, particularly seasonal flooding from the adjacent river. This designation implies that the community is officially recognized as vulnerable, which may necessitate emergency planning, infrastructure reinforcement, or evacuation protocols. Given its small size but formal recognition in disaster preparedness systems, the group represents a focal point for risk mitigation efforts. The proximity to a waterway increases the urgency of monitoring and resilience planning, especially during periods of heavy rainfall or upstream water release.

This relationship suggests that public services such as sanitation, emergency response, and infrastructure maintenance are likely coordinated at the village level. The high combined degree of the relationship between Huangni Village and Xing Long Group (degree 13) underscores the strength and significance of this administrative linkage. As a result, any policy changes or resource allocations at the village level could directly impact the residents of Xing Long Group. This hierarchical structure also implies that data collection, disaster response planning, and development initiatives are likely channeled through Huangni Village authorities.

Its presence enables transportation and mobility for nearby communities, including Xing Long Group. The bridge’s infrastructure code suggests it is formally cataloged in regional transportation systems, which may imply adherence to engineering standards and inclusion in maintenance schedules. Its role in connecting settlements across the river is vital for access to markets, healthcare, and emergency services. Failure or damage to this bridge—especially during flood events—could isolate Xing Long Group, disrupting essential movement and response capabilities. The bridge’s condition and resilience are therefore critical factors in community continuity.

This spatial and infrastructural linkage indicates that the residents of Xing Long Group likely depend on this bridge for daily travel and external connectivity. The combined degree of 5 for this relationship reflects a meaningful but not dominant connection, suggesting that while the bridge is important, alternative routes or access points may exist or be under development. Nevertheless, in flood-prone conditions, river crossings become bottlenecks, and this bridge may represent the only viable passage during certain periods. Ensuring its structural integrity and operational status is thus essential for community safety and resilience.

Floodwaters may render the bridge impassable or damage its foundation, simultaneously increasing danger to residents and hindering evacuation or aid delivery. This interdependence amplifies the overall vulnerability of the community. Mitigation strategies must therefore consider both shelter-in-place measures for residents and the redundancy or reinforcement of critical infrastructure. The presence of formal identifiers (e.g., infrastructure code and flood list inclusion) suggests that these risks are documented, but the data does not indicate whether adaptive measures have been implemented.
