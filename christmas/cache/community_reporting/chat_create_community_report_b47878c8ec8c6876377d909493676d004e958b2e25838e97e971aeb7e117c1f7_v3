Multiple specialized forms—including those for enterprises, riverine villages, urban households, reservoirs, and building cross-sections—are all subtypes of this overarching survey framework. These entities are structurally unified through hierarchical 'is a type of' relationships, indicating a systematic approach to flood risk assessment and management across different infrastructure and population segments.\",\n    \"rating\": 6.8,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the critical role these survey forms play in flood disaster preparedness, risk assessment, and emergency planning across populated and infrastructural domains.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Central role of '调查表' as the foundational data collection framework\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The entity '调查表' (Survey Form) functions as the central hub within this community, with all other entities being specific implementations or subtypes of it. It is described as a standardized tool for recording flash flood-related data, including engineering works, household information, and evacuation routes. This foundational role enables consistent data gathering across diverse domains, which is essential for coordinated disaster response and planning. The high combined degree scores (up to 13) in relationships involving '调查表' further emphasize its connectivity and centrality within the network [Data: Entities (272); Relationships (271, 273, 272, 282, 283, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Specialization of survey forms for different geographic and demographic units\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Multiple survey forms are tailored to specific geographic and demographic contexts, enhancing the precision of flood risk data collection. For example, '沿河村落居民户调查表' (Riverine Village Household Survey) focuses on households in flood-prone rural areas, while '重要城集镇居民户调查表' (Important Township Household Survey) targets urban populations. This differentiation allows authorities to assess vulnerability and resilience at a granular level, supporting targeted mitigation strategies. The existence of distinct forms for different settlement types reflects an understanding of heterogeneous risk profiles across rural and urban landscapes [Data: Entities (260, 259); Relationships (273, 272)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Inclusion of infrastructure-specific assessments through dedicated forms\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Beyond household and organizational data, the survey ecosystem includes forms focused on critical infrastructure. The '水库调查表' (Reservoir Survey Form) captures information on reservoir capacity, flood调度 (scheduling), and safety status, which are vital for upstream flood control. Similarly, the '建筑物断面测量调查表' (Building Cross-Section Measurement Survey) records topographic and elevation data at building sites, enabling analysis of flood inundation impacts on structures. These technical instruments support engineering assessments and emergency modeling, contributing to systemic resilience planning [Data: Entities (266, 267); Relationships (282, 283)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Standardized data collection for enterprise and institutional flood preparedness\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The '企业事业单位调查表' (Enterprise and Public Institution Survey Form) provides a mechanism to evaluate the flood readiness of non-residential entities. By standardizing the recording of flood-related information for businesses and government agencies, this form supports continuity planning and resource allocation during emergencies. Organizations captured through this form may also serve as potential evacuation centers or logistical hubs, increasing their strategic importance in disaster response.
