It is directly associated with environmental maintenance tasks, particularly river channel clearance to ensure flood flow, and hosts subordinate locations such as 陆家桥 and 老鼠寨. The town's role in managing small watershed areas indicates its importance in regional environmental governance and disaster prevention. This central position suggests that any failure in its management duties could have cascading effects on flood resilience in the area.

This responsibility is essential for preventing localized flooding and infrastructure damage, particularly in low-lying or densely populated areas within the watershed. The existence of this documented task suggests recognized vulnerability to hydrological hazards, and the town's capacity to perform this maintenance effectively directly influences community safety and environmental health.

Their inclusion suggests that these locations may be particularly susceptible to erosion, runoff, or flooding, necessitating integration into broader flood control and ecological restoration efforts. As subcomponents of Xingshan Town, their environmental conditions contribute to the overall hydrological performance of the region, and their management is likely coordinated through the town’s administrative framework.

This is evidenced by the directional relationships stating that Lujiaqiao is situated in Xingshan Town and Laoshu Village is located within it. This hierarchy implies that administrative decisions, resource allocation, and environmental interventions are likely centralized at the town level, with impacts flowing down to the village and site levels. Effective governance thus depends on the town's ability to monitor and manage these dispersed but interconnected locations.
