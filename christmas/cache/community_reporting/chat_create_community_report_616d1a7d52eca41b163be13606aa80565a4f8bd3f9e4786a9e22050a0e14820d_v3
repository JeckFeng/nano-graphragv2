This analysis is documented using tables and figures, indicating a structured scientific approach to understanding flood behavior. The outputs of this analysis are critical for floodplain mapping, infrastructure design, and emergency preparedness in the region. By modeling water levels at different annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs), such as the 1% AEP referenced in the data, the study supports risk-informed decision-making.

It is specifically referenced in hydrological documentation, notably in Figure 5.3-14, which illustrates the water surface profile along this branch. This figure contributes directly to the broader Water Surface Profile Analysis, indicating that Branch B is an important unit of study within flood risk modeling. The inclusion of this branch in formal figures suggests it is a prioritized area for monitoring and assessment, potentially due to its vulnerability to flooding or proximity to populated or critical areas.

These data points are essential for ensuring accuracy in predicting flood extents and water flow dynamics across the river system. The reliance on GDZA1 indicates its role as a key observational node, likely equipped with gauges or sensors that capture real-time or historical hydrological conditions. The integration of such point-source data into comprehensive analyses underscores the data-driven nature of flood risk management in this region.

Visual tools like this enable engineers, planners, and policymakers to interpret complex hydrological data more effectively. The diagram likely illustrates elevation changes, flow gradients, and critical thresholds that inform infrastructure placement and emergency response planning. The formal referencing of this figure in technical documents reflects adherence to standardized hydrological assessment practices, enhancing the credibility and utility of the analysis.

GDZA1 feeds elevation data into the analysis, while data from Branch B—particularly the Wengwei River—are visualized and interpreted through figures that contribute to the overall assessment. This interconnected structure ensures that the final analysis is both empirically grounded and spatially contextualized. Such integration is essential for producing reliable flood risk models that can be used in regulatory, planning, and emergency management contexts.
