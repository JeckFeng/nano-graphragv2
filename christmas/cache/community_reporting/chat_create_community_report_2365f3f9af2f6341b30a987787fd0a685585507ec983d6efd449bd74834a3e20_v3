The events are linked through eyewitness testimony from Z-AGE, a 58-year-old villager from Xiaozhai, who described both floods and emphasized the greater impact of the 1996 event. The 1996 flood is documented with precise hydrological data, including a high water mark at 823.59m elevation and a peak flow of 376 m³/s at station GDZ46, while the 2014 flood lacks such measurable evidence.

This level of detail suggests that the event was significant both in scale and in its documentation, providing valuable data for hydrological modeling and flood risk assessment. The precise measurement of water elevation and flow rate indicates that this event may serve as a benchmark for extreme flooding in the region. Such data is critical for infrastructure planning and emergency preparedness, particularly in areas prone to riverine flooding.

According to Z-AGE, the 1996 flood was substantially larger and had a more severe impact, with floodwaters submerging their backyard—an indicator of localized inundation. This testimony serves as a critical data point in the absence of instrumental records for the 2014 flood and helps corroborate the severity of the 1996 event. Eyewitness accounts like Z-AGE’s are often used in paleoflood and historical flood studies to extend the record of extreme events beyond the scope of official monitoring.

The only record of this flood comes from the same local villager, Z-AGE, who reported it but emphasized its lesser severity compared to the 1996 event. The absence of verifiable physical or hydrological data limits the utility of this event for scientific or planning purposes. However, its mention in comparison highlights the value placed on relative memory in assessing flood risk over time. This contrast underscores potential gaps in flood monitoring and documentation between major and minor events.

This comparison, while anecdotal, plays an important role in contextualizing flood magnitude over time, especially in regions with limited instrumental records. Such qualitative assessments can inform risk models by providing relative severity rankings when absolute data is missing. The comparison also suggests that while smaller floods occur, the 1996 event remains a standout in community memory, possibly indicating a return period of decades for such extreme events. This kind of insight is crucial for long-term resilience planning.

As a long-term resident of Xiaozhai, Z-AGE’s observations ground the flood records in human impact, such as backyard submersion, which can be more relatable than abstract hydrological metrics. This personal account adds a socio-environmental dimension to the data, emphasizing how communities perceive and remember natural disasters. The reliance on individual memory also introduces potential for bias or degradation over time, but when preserved, such narratives become key assets in environmental history and disaster preparedness.
