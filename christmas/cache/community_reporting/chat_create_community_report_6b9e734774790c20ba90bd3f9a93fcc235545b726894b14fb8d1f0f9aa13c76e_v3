This entity functions as a classification for high-risk infrastructure, linking all survey forms to a common purpose: identifying and mitigating potential disaster sources. The repeated association of survey forms with 风险隐患 underscores its centrality in the risk assessment process. By categorizing infrastructure as potential hazards, authorities can prioritize inspections and allocate resources more effectively for disaster prevention.

Bridges are explicitly identified as potential 风险隐患, particularly in flood-prone areas where structural failure could lead to catastrophic consequences. The survey form enables standardized data collection, which supports risk modeling and emergency planning.

Culverts are highlighted as common sources of risk during flash floods, particularly when blockages or structural weaknesses lead to road washouts or localized flooding. This survey form ensures that culverts are systematically assessed for resilience and included in broader hazard mitigation planning.

The survey form enables early identification of structural flaws and operational risks, supporting preventive maintenance and emergency response planning.
