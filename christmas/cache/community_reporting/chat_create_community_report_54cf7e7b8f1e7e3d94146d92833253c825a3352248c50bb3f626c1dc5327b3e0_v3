Spanning from 2025 to 2028, this project involves advanced surveying techniques including UAV-based oblique photography, LiDAR data collection, and 3D reconstruction of a small watershed area. Its high degree centrality (7) reflects its extensive connectivity with other entities, indicating its pivotal role in integrating technical standards, data collection methods, and data management protocols. The project's long duration and technical complexity suggest it is a major investment in geospatial data infrastructure.

This technique provides valuable validation data for aerial models and improves the realism and utility of the final 3D reconstructions. The data is collected directly within the study area, linking it geographically and functionally to the main project. This integration supports multi-perspective analysis, useful for environmental monitoring, urban planning, or public visualization.

This protocol mandates dual backups of all aerial data on separate mobile hard drives, with management assigned to different team members to prevent single points of failure or unauthorized access. By distributing control and ensuring redundancy, the procedure mitigates risks related to data loss, corruption, or breaches. The formalization of this process reflects a high level of organizational maturity and risk awareness in handling sensitive geospatial data.
