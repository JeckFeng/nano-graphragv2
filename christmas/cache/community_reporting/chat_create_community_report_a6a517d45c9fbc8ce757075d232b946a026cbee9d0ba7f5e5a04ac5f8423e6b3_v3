Equipped with LiDAR technology, it enables high-resolution 3D spatial mapping essential for topographic and hydrographic surveys. Its deployment marks the initiation of the entire data workflow, making it a critical asset in ensuring data accuracy and coverage. The drone's role is directly tied to the success of downstream processes, including editing and final data compilation.

This phase involves refining cross-section data to correct anomalies, remove noise, and enhance structural fidelity. Data editing acts as a quality control checkpoint, ensuring that inaccuracies from the collection phase are addressed before final assembly.
