The descriptions indicate that the focus of studies and management projects is on sub-watersheds like Chong’an River 001, which lies within Guizhou, not Hunan. Therefore, the referenced 'Dongting Lake Water System' likely refers to a misnamed or regionally redefined watershed rather than the actual hydrological system connected to the Yangtze River via Hunan.

Its role in scientific studies—particularly those concerning flood hazards, water blockage, and overflow impacts—highlights its significance for regional disaster prevention.

This suggests a hierarchical classification where even distantly connected or mislabeled tributaries are administratively grouped under major basins for management purposes.
