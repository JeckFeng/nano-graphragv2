Wengwei Group is a key site for environmental monitoring and field surveys, particularly along the Gudangzhai River at monitoring point GDZ28. Three individuals—Wang Yingqing, Yu Zaitao, and Bao Chengyun—are documented as contact persons for Wengwei Group, indicating their roles in local coordination and potential involvement in data collection efforts. The relationships between the hamlets and Guyang Village reflect a hierarchical administrative structure typical of rural Chinese governance, where smaller clusters contribute to regional demographic, socio-economic, and environmental datasets.

This site serves not only administrative and demographic functions but also contributes scientific data relevant to hydrology and rural environmental studies. Field surveys conducted in Wengwei Group have included photographic documentation and observational data collection, suggesting structured research efforts aimed at understanding local conditions. These activities imply that Wengwei Group is a prioritized location for data gathering, potentially influencing local planning, resource management, or policy decisions. Its geographic position along a river may also relate to agricultural practices, flood risk monitoring, or ecological conservation, further amplifying its functional significance. The integration of Wengwei Group into both community and scientific frameworks highlights its dual role as a residential cluster and a node in environmental surveillance networks.

These hamlets are not independent villages but rather localized clusters where population and household data are recorded for governance, planning, and statistical purposes. This hierarchical organization is characteristic of rural Chinese administrative systems, where central village authorities manage smaller residential units for efficiency in service delivery, census operations, and development projects. The formal recognition of these groups in local records and field surveys reinforces their legitimacy as sub-localities within the governance framework. Each hamlet contributes to the broader demographic and socio-economic profile of Guyang Village, serving as a granular unit for data disaggregation and targeted interventions. The consistency in documentation across entities supports the integrity of this administrative model and its utility in rural management.

Each individual is linked to a unique mobile phone number: Wang Yingqing (185855 35510), Yu Zaitao (13985842282), and Bao Chengyun (182855 50285), with segmented numerical identifiers (e.g., 185855 and 35510) appearing in data systems, possibly for administrative ease. These contact listings appear in the context of field survey documentation, further implying involvement in research or data collection initiatives. The presence of multiple designated contacts may reflect redundancy planning, role specialization (e.g., one for environmental monitoring, another for demographic outreach), or rotational responsibilities within the group. The consistency of contact details across sources strengthens the reliability of their associations and underscores their functional centrality in Wengwei Group’s operations.

These surveys include photographic documentation, demographic recording, and environmental assessment, indicating a multidisciplinary approach to understanding local realities. The data gathered likely supports administrative planning, academic research, or development programming, with potential applications in infrastructure, public health, or natural resource management. The use of standardized methodologies across hamlets enables comparative analysis and ensures data consistency, enhancing the utility of findings at the village or regional level. Wengwei Group’s inclusion in hydrological monitoring further expands the scope of these surveys to include environmental indicators, making it a particularly valuable site within the network. The involvement of named contacts like Wang Yingqing and Yu Zaitao implies that these surveys are conducted with community participation, increasing data accuracy and local ownership. Overall, field surveys serve as a critical link between local residents and external institutions, facilitating evidence-based decision-making in rural governance.

Their roles likely involve disseminating information, coordinating participation, and interfacing with external researchers or officials. The fact that all three are associated with Wengwei Group—rather than spread across different hamlets—suggests that this group may be a pilot site, priority zone, or administrative hub within Guyang Village. Their phone numbers are consistently recorded, and in some cases segmented numerically (e.g., 139858 and 42282 for Yu Zaitao), which may reflect data entry conventions in survey systems or local databases. The absence of contradictory information across records strengthens confidence in their identities and roles. Minor spelling variations such as 'Goyang Village' instead of 'Guyang Village' are best interpreted as transcription errors given the identical contact details and contextual alignment. These individuals collectively form a communication backbone that supports data collection, community mobilization, and administrative continuity in Wengwei Group, reinforcing its functional importance within the broader village system.

This monitoring site likely contributes to regional water resource management, flood forecasting, or ecological assessments, providing time-series data on river conditions. Such data is critical for understanding seasonal variations, climate impacts, and land-use effects on water systems in rural areas. The integration of this monitoring function within a residential hamlet suggests collaboration between local residents and scientific or governmental agencies, possibly through the involvement of contact persons like Wang Yingqing or Yu Zaitao. The presence of structured field surveys in the same location further supports the idea that Wengwei Group is a node in a broader environmental observation network. This role enhances the community’s strategic value beyond its demographic size, positioning it as a contributor to regional sustainability and resilience efforts. The long-term maintenance of monitoring infrastructure at GDZ28 implies institutional support and ongoing data utilization, reinforcing the significance of Wengwei Group in environmental governance.
