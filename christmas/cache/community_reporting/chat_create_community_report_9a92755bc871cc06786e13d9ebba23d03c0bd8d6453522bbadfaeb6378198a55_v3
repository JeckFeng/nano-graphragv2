It functions as a cohesive rural settlement under the jurisdiction of Gudong (or Gutong) Town in Magang County. The village's structure reflects a typical hierarchical organization in rural Chinese administrative systems, where a central village governs multiple smaller hamlets or residential clusters. These subgroups are not independent entities but are integrated into Baisha Village’s governance framework, with collective responsibilities for public services, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness. The village has been the focus of field surveys that include photographic documentation, indicating its significance in regional planning and ethnographic or environmental research. These studies likely support efforts in rural development, risk assessment, or cultural preservation. The presence of formal documentation and administrative roles, such as that of Liu Yong, further underscores the institutional attention the village receives.

It is not an independent administrative unit but operates under the governance of Baisha Village, contributing to the broader social and cultural fabric of the community. The fact that survey photographs were taken in Gedangzhai Group indicates that it is a site of observational interest, possibly due to its architectural layout, settlement pattern, or demographic characteristics. This level of documentation suggests that Gedangzhai Group may serve as a representative sample for understanding rural life in the region. The consistency in references to Gedangzhai Group across multiple records—including its alternate names such as Gedangzhai or Geda—further confirms its status as a stable and recognized component of Baisha Village. Its repeated association with survey activities highlights its role in data-driven initiatives related to environmental risk, infrastructure planning, or community development.

Like Gedangzhai Group, Pingzhai Group is administratively subordinate to Baisha Village and functions as a localized residential cluster. Its inclusion in photographic surveys indicates that it is a point of interest for data collection, likely related to rural settlement patterns, infrastructure access, or environmental conditions. The documentation of Pingzhai Group supports broader efforts to assess living conditions and disaster resilience within Baisha Village. The minor variations in spelling—such as Pingszai versus Pingzhai—are likely due to transliteration differences rather than indicating distinct locations. The consistency of its association with Baisha Village across multiple records confirms its role as a core component of the village’s structure.

These structures are essential for mitigating the risk of mountain floods, to which the village is explicitly vulnerable due to its geographical location. The presence of multiple concrete dams indicates a systematic approach to environmental risk reduction, likely supported by local or regional authorities. River Bridge 07, located in Ge Dang Village (a reference to Gedangzhai) within Baisha Village, serves both transportation and flood infrastructure functions, enhancing connectivity while contributing to water flow regulation. The integration of these structures into the village landscape reflects a proactive stance on disaster preparedness and community safety. Their documentation in relationship records suggests that they are formally recognized components of the village’s infrastructure network, possibly maintained or monitored as part of broader rural development programs.

The assignment of a named official to Baisha Village suggests that it is part of a structured administrative system where performance and compliance are monitored. This level of oversight may be linked to regional development initiatives, disaster risk management programs, or governmental field surveys. The fact that Liu Yong’s role is explicitly documented in the relationship data underscores the institutional framework within which Baisha Village operates. It also implies that the community is not isolated but integrated into broader governance and planning mechanisms.
