The area is also the site of the Xiniutan Reservoir construction project, a major initiative aimed at securing urban drinking water supplies, highlighting its dual role in development and environmental protection [Data: Entities (61)].

Additionally, two instances of channel narrowing were recorded in Xingshan Street, contributing to flood risk by constricting water flow during heavy rainfall [Data: Entities (306); Relationships (268)]. These findings demonstrate that Xingshan Street is not only historically vulnerable but continues to develop new geohazards, requiring ongoing monitoring and adaptive management strategies to mitigate the risk of flash flooding and associated disasters [Data: Entities (61, 296); Relationships (268, 365, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Critical water management infrastructure in Xingshan Street\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xingshan Street hosts several key water infrastructure assets essential for both flood control and water supply.

Road culverts were also documented as part of the flood risk assessment, though specific counts for Xingshan Street are implied through comparative data with Gudong Town [Data: Entities (299); Relationships (360)]. The presence of the Xiniutan Reservoir project further emphasizes the area's strategic importance in regional water security, as it is designed to supply drinking water to urban populations [Data: Entities (61)].
