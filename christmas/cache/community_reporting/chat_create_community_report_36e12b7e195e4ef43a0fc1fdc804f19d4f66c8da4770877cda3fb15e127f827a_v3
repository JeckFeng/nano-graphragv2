It is specifically labeled as the segment where multiple cross-sections (e.g., GDZA1 and GDZA8) are established, indicating its central role in hydrological monitoring. The creek's inclusion in Table 5.3-8 for water surface elevation calculations across various flood return periods underscores its significance in flood risk assessment. As a natural drainage feature, Gubin Creek contributes to the overall behavior of the river system during extreme weather events, and its accurate modeling is essential for downstream impact predictions.

With a degree of 13, this entity has the highest connectivity among all entities, linking directly to nearly every measurement point. Its designation indicates a formalized segment of the river system used for engineering and planning purposes, likely part of an official floodplain management or environmental impact study. The systematic naming convention (e.g., GDZA#S for left bank, GDZA#X for right bank) reflects standardized hydrological survey practices, enhancing data reliability and consistency.

These points are distributed from upstream to downstream, allowing for the construction of continuous water surface profiles under different return periods. For instance, GDZA1 marks the initial analysis point, while GDZA8 represents the final measured section, indicating a progression of data collection along the creek. The pairing of left-bank (e.g., GDZA3S, GDZA6S) and right-bank (e.g., GDZA3X, GDZA6X) sections enables symmetric modeling of river hydraulics, improving the accuracy of floodplain delineation. This systematic approach supports robust flood forecasting and infrastructure resilience planning.

Water surface elevations are recorded at each cross-section, enabling engineers to predict how high water will rise during different levels of flood events. This data is critical for determining floodplain boundaries, designing flood protection systems, and informing land-use planning. For example, GDZA5 is noted for showing a significant drop in elevation downstream, which can influence flow velocity and floodwave attenuation. The final cross-section, GDZA8, shows minimal variation across return periods, suggesting a stabilized or channelized reach where flood response is less sensitive to storm magnitude. These findings are essential for risk modeling and emergency preparedness strategies.

This is evident in entries such as GDZA5 and GDZA7, both described as downstream sections where declining elevations are recorded. This topographic gradient drives the flow of water and influences flood dynamics, including flow velocity, inundation extent, and drainage efficiency. The minimal variation in GDZA8 across flood scenarios suggests that the lowermost reach may be approaching base level or influenced by downstream control structures. Understanding this longitudinal profile is vital for modeling flood propagation and identifying areas prone to prolonged inundation or rapid flooding.
