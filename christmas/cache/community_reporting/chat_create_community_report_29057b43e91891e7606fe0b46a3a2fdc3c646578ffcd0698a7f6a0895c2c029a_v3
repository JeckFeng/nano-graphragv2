The village is composed of structured subgroups such as the Lantang Group and Tangzu Group, with several documented residents—Tang Zhongping, Xiong Yue, and Chen Guozhong—affiliated with the Lantang Group. These individuals are formally listed in local records, indicating a well-organized system of community governance. Daping Village is linked to broader regional dynamics through its location within Gudong Town, which has been identified as containing flash flood hazard zones, raising environmental risk considerations.

These water bodies are integral to local water management, agriculture, and potentially small-scale energy initiatives, contributing to both ecological sustainability and community livelihoods. The Xiaoba Reservoir is explicitly located within Daping Village, making the village a key node in regional hydrological systems [Data: Relationships (105)]. Given the reliance of rural communities on stable water sources, any disruption to these systems—whether from environmental degradation or climate events—could significantly affect local residents. The presence of such critical infrastructure underscores the strategic importance of Daping Village beyond its size or population. Its role in water regulation may also imply oversight responsibilities or integration into county-level environmental planning, further elevating its administrative relevance in Majiang County.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Administrative structure through community groups\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Daping Village is organized into subgroups such as the Lantang Group and the Tangzu Group, reflecting a formalized administrative framework common in rural China. These groups likely serve as units for governance, resource distribution, or collective action, enabling more efficient local management. The existence of such subdivisions is corroborated by the consistent listing of residents within specific groups—e.g., Tang Zhongping, Xiong Yue, and Chen Guozhong all documented in the Lantang Group—indicating a structured civil registration system [Data: Entities (101, 312, 313, 314); Relationships (355, 356, 357)]. This hierarchical organization allows authorities to monitor residency, coordinate public services, and mobilize community efforts effectively. The stability and clarity of these affiliations suggest that Daping Village maintains reliable administrative records, which is essential for disaster response, census activities, and development planning. The integration of personal identity with group membership reinforces social cohesion and accountability within the village.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Key residents with formal community roles\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Several individuals—Tang Zhongping, Xiong Yue, and Chen Guozhong—are formally associated with the Lantang Group in Daping Village, with Tang Zhongping and Xiong Yue listed with contact numbers (15870211109 and 15870265078, respectively), indicating accessible points of contact for community coordination [Data: Entities (312, 313); Relationships (355, 356)]. Tang Zhongping is explicitly described as a contact person representing the community, suggesting a leadership or liaison role in local affairs. Similarly, Xiong Yue’s dual status as a resident and contact implies a functional role in communication or organization within the Lantang Group. Chen Guozhong, while lacking a listed phone number, is still officially registered, confirming his recognized status within the community structure [Data: Entity (314); Relationship (357)]. The presence of multiple documented contacts enhances the resilience and responsiveness of the village, especially during emergencies or administrative updates.

This clarification is essential for accurate data integration, especially in administrative, environmental, or emergency response contexts where misspellings could lead to misidentification. The standardized spelling 'Daping Village' aligns with official geographic naming conventions in Guizhou Province, reinforcing its legitimacy in official systems. The resolution of this variation enhances data reliability and ensures that all references to the village, regardless of orthographic differences, can be correctly attributed to a single geographic and administrative entity. This consistency supports effective governance, resource allocation, and inter-agency coordination involving Daping Village.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Environmental risks due to flash flood hazards\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Gudong Town, in which Daping Village is situated, has been identified as containing 11 newly recognized flash flood hazard zones, indicating significant environmental vulnerability [Data: Relationship (439)]. Given that Daping Village hosts the Xiaoba Reservoir—a body of water that could contribute to downstream flooding under extreme weather conditions—the community may be situated in or near one of these high-risk areas. Flash floods pose serious threats to rural settlements, including property damage, infrastructure failure, and loss of life, particularly in regions with limited early warning systems or evacuation resources. The presence of documented residents and critical water infrastructure in this context amplifies the potential impact of such events. This risk factor elevates the importance of Daping Village in regional disaster preparedness planning and underscores the need for robust monitoring, community education, and emergency response protocols. The integration of Daping Village into hazard mapping efforts is essential for mitigating future risks.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Administrative linkage to Gudong Town and Baisa Village\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Daping Village is located within Gudong Town, placing it under the broader administrative jurisdiction of this township, which also includes Baisa Village [Data: Entity (101); Relationship (352)].

While Baisa Village and Daping Village are distinct, their shared administrative framework suggests comparable governance models and potential coordination in regional initiatives. Liu Yong, associated with multiple groups in Baisa Village, mirrors the pattern of community-level engagement seen in Daping’s Lantang Group contacts, indicating a broader trend of localized leadership across Gudong Town [Data: Entity (311); Relationship (353)]. This structural similarity supports the scalability of administrative practices and emergency response protocols across villages.
