The creek is specifically noted for its role in supporting cross-sectional measurements used in hydraulic modeling, which are essential for predicting flood behavior under varying return periods (e.g., 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%). These models inform risk assessments and engineering designs related to flood control and infrastructure resilience. The creek's central function is further reinforced by its connections to multiple measurement points along its length.

This relationship underscores the creek’s significance in the broader river system, particularly for hydrodynamic analysis. The use of multiple cross-sectional data points along this branch suggests a comprehensive monitoring framework aimed at understanding flow characteristics and floodplain behavior. Such integration is vital for regional water resource management and disaster preparedness planning.

Although its description is limited, its placement at the beginning of the measurement sequence implies that it serves as a baseline reference for upstream hydrological conditions. This data point is critical for establishing initial flow parameters in hydraulic models, which are then propagated downstream to assess changes in water elevation and velocity. Its connection to Gubin Creek highlights its importance in the overall data collection framework.

The data collected at this point show minimal variation across different flood return periods, suggesting a stable or regulated flow regime in the lower reaches of the creek. This stability could be due to natural topographic constraints or anthropogenic interventions such as channel modifications or flow control structures. As the terminal measurement point, GDZA8 provides critical validation data for model accuracy and flood inundation predictions.

These return periods correspond to increasing levels of flood severity, with the 1% event representing a '100-year flood'. The availability of such data indicates a sophisticated approach to flood risk assessment, enabling planners to evaluate potential inundation zones, design flood defenses, and implement land-use regulations.
