This investigation integrates multiple aspects of risk management, including the delineation of danger zones, evaluation of geological hazards such as debris flows, and the documentation of vulnerable populations and economic assets like enterprises and tourist sites. It functions as a comprehensive data-gathering operation that links technical processes—such as aerial imagery acquisition and hydrological modeling—with on-the-ground verification activities conducted at the village and town levels. The high degree centrality (17) of this entity in the network underscores its pivotal role in connecting various stakeholders, data sources, and physical features. Its scope encompasses both natural systems (e.g.,沟道束,塘堰坝) and social infrastructure (e.g.,村委会,居委会), making it the backbone of flood risk governance in the region.

These are areas identified through technical analysis—supported by航飞影像采集 (aerial imaging) and水文计算 (hydrological modeling)—as being susceptible to inundation during extreme rainfall events. Field teams conduct in-situ verification in these zones, collecting 720-degree panoramic imagery and demographic data such as housing counts and population distribution. This information is essential for designing early warning systems, evacuation routes, and emergency response plans. The integration of遥感数据 with实地调查 ensures that hazard zone boundaries are scientifically robust and operationally actionable. With a degree of 5, '危险区' is one of the most connected entities, linked not only to technical inputs but also to administrative bodies like村委会 and physical features like转移路线 and安置点. Its central position indicates that all aspects of the investigation ultimately serve to refine and act upon these designated zones.

As基层行政单位 (grassroots administrative units), they organize and facilitate the verification of key risk-related data, including the status of地质灾害点, the integrity of转移路线, and the availability of安置点. They also coordinate with防汛负责人 to confirm防洪信息, ensuring that local knowledge informs technical assessments. The committee serves as the primary liaison between technical survey teams and residents, enabling accurate data collection from自然村组 and村落. Their involvement enhances data reliability and community engagement, both of which are vital for effective disaster preparedness.

These features are particularly vulnerable to erosion, scour, or structural failure during flash flood events, potentially leading to cascading impacts on transportation, water control, and public safety. For instance,跨沟路段 and桥涵 are prone to being washed out by concentrated flows, while塘堰坝 may collapse under excessive pressure, exacerbating downstream flooding. Each of these is subject to现场核实 (on-site verification), where their structural condition, location, and functional status are recorded for risk modeling and mitigation planning. Their inclusion in the survey highlights the emphasis on protecting not just people but also essential built systems that support rural and peri-urban communities.

Debris flows are recognized as a common secondary hazard triggered by heavy rainfall in mountainous areas, often co-occurring with flash floods. They pose severe threats due to their high velocity, destructive force, and ability to impact large areas downstream. The调查 process includes identifying source, flow, and deposition zones for mudslides, using both historical data and field observations such as历史洪痕测量点. These sites are validated through现场复核 led by村委会, and 720-degree imaging is used to document terrain conditions. By integrating泥石流 risk into the broader flood hazard framework, the survey enables a more holistic understanding of multi-hazard environments, especially in steep, erosion-prone watersheds.

These paths must remain accessible even under partial flooding, necessitating structural assessments of crossings and adjacent terrain. 安置点 are designated safe zones where residents can be relocated temporarily; their suitability is evaluated based on elevation, capacity, and access. Both types of locations are validated through现场核查 with村委会 assistance, ensuring accuracy and local acceptance. This planning directly supports the development of emergency response protocols and is a key output of the investigation, contributing to life-saving preparedness.

These digital tools are not used in isolation but are validated through实地复核, where local teams collect ground-truth data such as panoramic images, GPS coordinates, and structural details. The融合 of remote sensing and on-site data ensures that the final risk maps are both scientifically sound and operationally relevant.

This granular data allows for the assessment of exposure levels and helps prioritize areas for intervention. For example, houses located near low-lying areas or below dams may be flagged for relocation or retrofitting. The use of工作底图 ensures that all housing locations are spatially referenced, enabling integration with hazard layers for comprehensive risk mapping.
