This table is linked to three key infrastructure types—bridges (桥梁), ponds/check dams (塘（堰）坝), and road culverts (跨沟路涵)—each of which was surveyed for structural and hydraulic characteristics such as water-blocking area, storage capacity, and flow capacity.

It includes summarized data on bridges, culverts, and ponds/dams, making it a critical aggregation point for infrastructure assessment. The high degree centrality (combined degree of 6 in two relationships) underscores its role as a key informational nexus. This table likely supports engineering evaluations, environmental planning, or disaster risk mitigation strategies by providing standardized metrics on structural performance and hydraulic capacity.

These metrics help determine how bridge designs may impede water flow during heavy rainfall events, potentially contributing to upstream flooding. The inclusion of this data in Table 5.2-2 indicates a formalized monitoring system aimed at evaluating infrastructure vulnerability. This level of detail suggests that local authorities are actively assessing civil infrastructure for risk management purposes.

These features are particularly important in rural or mountainous regions where small-scale water retention structures support agriculture while also posing potential failure risks during extreme weather. Their inclusion in Table 5.2-2 highlights an integrated approach to managing both water supply and downstream flood risks, emphasizing the importance of decentralized water infrastructure in regional planning.

These culverts are critical for maintaining road integrity during rain events and preventing gully erosion or road washouts. The data collected supports infrastructure maintenance planning and helps identify chokepoints in drainage systems. Although 跨沟路涵 has a lower degree (1) and is linked only through a single relationship, its inclusion in Table 5.2-2 suggests that even smaller drainage structures are part of a broader risk assessment framework.

This integration is particularly valuable for local governments managing limited resources in ecologically sensitive or flood-prone regions like Majiang County.
