This system significantly improves positioning accuracy compared to standalone GPS, achieving centimeter-level precision. Its application is essential in fields requiring exact spatial data, such as land surveying, construction, and geographic information systems (GIS). The technology functions by comparing signals received at multiple reference stations to calculate and transmit correction data to roving receivers. This process minimizes errors caused by atmospheric interference, satellite orbit discrepancies, and clock drift. Network RTK's integration into modern surveying workflows marks a shift from traditional static survey methods to dynamic, real-time solutions.

This system serves as the foundational support for Network RTK by providing the real-time correction signals necessary for high-precision positioning across Guizhou Province. By transmitting differential correction data via communication networks, the Guizhou CORS system allows mobile GNSS receivers to compute accurate coordinates in real time. This enables surveyors and engineers to conduct fieldwork efficiently without setting up temporary base stations. The reliance of Network RTK on such a CORS network highlights the interdependency between regional geospatial infrastructures and advanced positioning technologies. The system’s stability and coverage directly affect the performance and reliability of Network RTK applications in the region.

Network RTK is the primary method employed in this process due to its ability to meet strict accuracy requirements for both planimetric coordinates and elevation. Traditionally, figure root surveys required time-consuming static observations with dual-frequency receivers; however, Network RTK streamlines this process by enabling rapid data acquisition with comparable or superior accuracy. The use of Network RTK eliminates the need for long observation periods and reduces equipment setup time, increasing operational efficiency. This integration enhances the scalability of surveying efforts across large areas, particularly in mountainous or remote regions like Guizhou, where accessibility can be challenging. The adoption of Network RTK in figure root control reflects a broader trend toward digital transformation in geomatics and civil engineering.

The Guizhou CORS system acts as the source of correction data that Network RTK leverages to deliver high-accuracy positioning. Without access to a stable and well-maintained CORS network, Network RTK would revert to less accurate methods or require deploying local base stations, negating many of its efficiency benefits. This interdependence underscores the importance of sustained investment in geospatial infrastructure to support advanced technologies. Furthermore, the reliability, density, and maintenance of the CORS stations directly influence the spatial accuracy and availability of Network RTK services across the province. Any disruption to the Guizhou CORS system—such as technical outages, signal interference, or cyber vulnerabilities—could have cascading effects on dependent surveying, construction, and mapping operations.

High-precision positioning is indispensable for the design, construction, and monitoring of infrastructure such as highways, railways, and bridges. In Guizhou’s rugged terrain, accurate elevation and coordinate data are essential for engineering feasibility and safety assessments. Additionally, these systems support land titling, cadastral surveys, and disaster monitoring efforts, contributing to governance and public safety. The availability of real-time, high-accuracy positioning also fosters innovation in emerging fields such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping, autonomous vehicles, and smart city applications.
