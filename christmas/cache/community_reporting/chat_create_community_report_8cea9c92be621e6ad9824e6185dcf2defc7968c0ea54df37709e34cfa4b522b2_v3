The State Council’s involvement ensures that these frameworks carry the highest level of legal authority and are binding across all levels of government. Its relationships with key regulatory instruments such as the National Overall Emergency Response Plan and the Interim Measures for Investigation and Assessment of Natural Disasters highlight its function as both a policy initiator and institutional enforcer.

This framework establishes standardized procedures for early warning, emergency response, inter-agency coordination, and post-disaster recovery, ensuring a unified approach across jurisdictions. As a formally issued state document, it reflects the institutionalization of crisis management within China's governance structure. The plan is directly linked to the State Council through its issuance, underscoring the central government’s role in crisis leadership. It provides the overarching structure under which specialized regulations and operational plans, such as those for dam safety and natural disaster assessment, are implemented.

It mandates cross-departmental collaboration among meteorological, hydrological, geological, and emergency management agencies to ensure comprehensive evaluations. By incorporating modern technologies such as remote sensing, GIS, and big data analytics, the measures improve the accuracy and timeliness of assessments. The framework also emphasizes transparency, traceability, and accountability, requiring responsible parties to be identified and lessons institutionalized for future planning.

Originally established and most recently revised in 2018, the regulation reflects ongoing state commitment to updating safety standards in line with technological and environmental changes. It defines clear responsibilities for government bodies, water administration departments, and dam operators throughout the lifecycle of a dam—from design and construction to operation, maintenance, and emergency response. Key provisions include mandatory safety inspections, real-time monitoring, risk identification, and the development of emergency action plans to prevent catastrophic failures during extreme weather events. The regulation also strengthens accountability by enabling legal liability for negligence or mismanagement. Furthermore, the 2018 revision enhanced the integration of information systems and digital monitoring platforms, promoting smart management of critical water infrastructure.

Each document—whether focused on emergency response, post-disaster assessment, or infrastructure safety—operates within a shared legal and administrative ecosystem governed by central authority. The State Council does not only issue these regulations but also ensures their enforcement through subordinate agencies and reporting mechanisms. For example, findings from investigations under the Interim Measures can inform updates to the National Emergency Response Plan or revisions to dam safety protocols. Similarly, incidents related to dam safety may trigger assessments under the Interim Measures and activate emergency procedures outlined in the overall response plan. This feedback-rich system enables adaptive governance, where operational experience directly informs policy refinement. Such integration reduces fragmentation and enhances systemic resilience against complex, cascading disasters.
