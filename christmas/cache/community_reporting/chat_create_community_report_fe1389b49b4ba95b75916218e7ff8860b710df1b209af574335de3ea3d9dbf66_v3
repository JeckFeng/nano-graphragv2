This site is critical for flood observation and watershed management, with strong ties to historical flood events—particularly the 1996 flood, which left measurable high-water marks at 823.59 m. Data collection at GDZ46 supports hydraulic modeling using tools like Manning’s formula, and local eyewitness accounts from residents such as Z MEAN provide contextual validation of flood severity. The 1996 flood serves as a key reference for the P=2% design flood (50-year return period) with a peak flow of 387 m³/s.

It is strategically located where the Gedangzhai River flows into the Xibu River, making it essential for monitoring cumulative runoff and flood dynamics. The site has a drainage area of 77.56 km², a Manning’s roughness coefficient of 0.052, and a longitudinal slope of 3.49‰ (0.349%), all of which are critical parameters for flow analysis. GDZ46 enables consistent stage-discharge measurements, supporting flood risk modeling, rating curve calibration, and long-term watershed studies. Its repeated association with flood events and hydraulic calculations underscores its operational importance in both real-time monitoring and design flood estimation [Data: Entities (403), Relationships (491, 519, 528, 531, 518, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The 1996 flood as a benchmark historical event\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 1996 flood is a pivotal event in the community's hydrological history, serving as a reference point for both physical measurements and design standards. It was documented through a measurable high-water mark at an elevation of 823.59 m near the GDZ46 cross-section, providing empirical evidence of its magnitude. The flood occurred on the Gedangzhai River and was described by local residents as significantly larger than the 2014 flood. These flood marks were used in hydraulic analyses to estimate peak flow and surface slope, contributing to the credibility of hydrological models. The presence of physical evidence—confirmed at the 1996年洪痕位置—enhances the reliability of retrospective flood assessments and supports current floodplain management decisions [Data: Entities (422, 417), Relationships (538, 519, 539, 521, 542, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integration of local knowledge through resident testimony\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Local eyewitness accounts, particularly from Z MEAN—a 58-year-old resident of Xiao Zhai—play a crucial role in validating and enriching hydrological data. Z MEAN provided a firsthand description of both the 1996 and 2014 floods, characterizing the 1996 event as a major inundation that significantly impacted the village. This qualitative data complements physical measurements by confirming the societal impact of the flood and aiding in the interpretation of historical events where instrumental records may be lacking. The relationship between XIAO ZHAI and DESIGN WATERSHED highlights the village’s role as a source of observational data, bridging scientific and community-based knowledge systems. This integration improves the accuracy of flood reconstructions and increases trust in risk assessments among local stakeholders [Data: Entities (419, 416), Relationships (515, 521, 518, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Use of Manning’s formula in hydraulic analysis\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Manning’s formula is applied at the GDZ46 cross-section to compute key hydraulic parameters of the 1996 flood, including surface slope and peak flow. This mathematical model, which estimates open channel flow based on channel roughness, slope, and cross-sectional geometry, is essential for deriving flow characteristics where direct measurements may not be available. At GDZ46, with a Manning’s n value of 0.052 and a slope of 3.49‰, the formula provides a scientifically grounded method for back-calculating the 1996 flood’s peak discharge of 376 m³/s. Its application demonstrates the integration of empirical models with field observations, enhancing the technical rigor of flood analysis. The use of standardized hydrological methods ensures consistency and reliability in water resource planning and design flood estimation [Data: Entities (428), Relationships (531, 538, 528, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"P=2% design flood as a benchmark for infrastructure planning\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The P=2% design flood (corresponding to a 50-year return period) is calculated specifically for the GDZ46 cross-section, with a peak flow of 387 m³/s. This design flood is considered reasonable and reliable based on analysis of historical data, including the 1996 flood event. It serves as a critical benchmark for engineering design, floodplain zoning, and risk management in the watershed. The proximity of this design value to the estimated 376 m³/s peak flow of the 1996 flood suggests that the historical event nearly reached or may have exceeded the 50-year flood threshold. This underscores the vulnerability of Xiao Zhai and downstream areas to high-magnitude events and emphasizes the importance of robust infrastructure and early warning systems. The formal adoption of this design standard reflects a data-informed approach to mitigating flood risk [Data: Entities (423), Relationships (528, 531, 519, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Absence of confirmed evidence for the 2014 flood\",\n            \"explanation\": \"While the 2014 flood is mentioned in local accounts as a smaller event compared to 1996, no physical flood marks were confirmed during field surveys. This lack of empirical evidence limits the ability to perform detailed hydraulic analysis or integrate the 2014 event into official flood records. The event is reported to have affected the WATERSHED RIVER REACH, but without measurable high-water marks, its peak flow and spatial extent remain uncertain. This contrast between documented historical floods and recent unverified events highlights challenges in continuous monitoring and data preservation. It also suggests possible changes in flood reporting practices or environmental conditions that affect the visibility or persistence of flood evidence. Continued community engagement and systematic surveying are needed to maintain data integrity over time [Data: Entities (418), Relationships (523, 518, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Xiao Zhai’s dual role as settlement and monitoring hub\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xiao Zhai (小寨) functions not only as a residential village but also as a focal point for hydrological monitoring and flood observation.
