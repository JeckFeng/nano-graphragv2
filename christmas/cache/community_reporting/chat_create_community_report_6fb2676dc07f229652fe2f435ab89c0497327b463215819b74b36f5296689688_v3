It is designed to irrigate 1,800 mu of farmland, indicating its significant role in supporting local agriculture. The reservoir is situated on a right-bank first-order tributary of the Gedangzhai River, which influences its water supply and flood risk profile. Its location within Huangni Village ties it directly to local communities dependent on its water resources [Data: Entities (67), Relationships (75, 79)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mayitang Reservoir’s role in Lanshan Village\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mayitang Reservoir, located in Lanshan Village, Gudong Town, is another small (2) type irrigation reservoir with a total capacity of 107,000 m³ and a design irrigation area of 580 mu. It lies on a left-bank first-order tributary of the Gedangzhai River, contributing to localized water distribution in the region. The presence of the Lanshan rainfall station in the same village suggests that hydrological monitoring is integrated into the area’s water management framework, potentially informing reservoir operations. This linkage highlights the importance of environmental data in managing water resources effectively [Data: Entities (68, 64), Relationships (76, 81)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Xiaoba Reservoir's contribution to Daping Village\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xiaoba Reservoir serves Daping Village in Gudong Town and has a total capacity of 124,000 m³, designed to irrigate 420 mu of farmland. It is located on a left-bank tributary of the Gedangzhai River known as Xiaoba River, placing it within the same watershed system as the other two reservoirs. Despite being smaller than Miaohuachong, Xiaoba Reservoir plays a vital role in sustaining agricultural productivity in its immediate vicinity.

This administrative function ensures operational coordination across the reservoirs, including maintenance, water release scheduling, and emergency preparedness. The consolidation of management under one local authority enhances efficiency but also centralizes responsibility, meaning any governance shortcomings could affect all three facilities simultaneously.

This relationship indicates that while day-to-day management is handled locally by Gudong Town, higher-level technical guidance and regulatory compliance are ensured by the county-level authority. This dual-layer governance model helps maintain engineering standards and safety protocols, especially important for aging or small-scale infrastructure that may be vulnerable to sedimentation, leakage, or overtopping during heavy rains.

This positioning means their water inflows are influenced by the same broader watershed dynamics, including rainfall patterns, upstream land use, and seasonal flow variations. Shared hydrological conditions imply that droughts or floods affecting the Gedangzhai River basin could simultaneously impact all three reservoirs, creating systemic risks.
