It contains both residential and agricultural land and is notable for hosting significant water management facilities, including the Xiaoba Reservoir and the concrete weir dam in the Lantang Group. The village is formally recognized as encompassing the Lantang Group, confirming its jurisdictional authority over this sub-unit. Its geographic and administrative consistency across records affirms its status despite minor transcription discrepancies, such as the occasional misstatement of 'Magang County' instead of 'Majiang County'. The dual presence of reservoir and weir dam infrastructure highlights the village’s importance in regional water distribution, irrigation, and flood mitigation. These functions are essential for sustaining local agriculture and domestic water needs, making Daping Village a critical node in the rural infrastructure network of Guding Town.

This structure is a man-made water control facility, likely serving irrigation or flood regulation purposes in the surrounding agricultural landscape. The Lantang Group’s administrative inclusion within Daping Village is consistently documented, reinforcing the hierarchical rural governance model in China. The presence of multiple named contacts—Tang Zhongping, Xiong Yue, and Chen Guozhong—associated specifically with Lantang Group suggests a localized management or coordination structure, possibly for infrastructure maintenance or emergency response. The weir dam’s placement in this sub-unit elevates its functional significance, as any structural issues or operational failures could directly impact downstream communities and farming activities. The concentration of both infrastructure and human contacts in Lantang Group makes it a critical focal point within the broader Daping Village system.

Weir dams are typically used to control water levels for irrigation, maintain streamflow, or prevent flash flooding in rural areas. Given the agricultural context of Daping Village, this structure likely supports irrigation systems that sustain local farming activities. Its classification as a 'concrete' weir suggests durability and engineered design, indicating official involvement in its construction or maintenance. The dam’s integration into the village’s infrastructure network underscores its importance in water resource management. However, such structures also carry inherent risks—particularly in regions prone to heavy rainfall or seismic activity—where failure could lead to flooding or water shortages. The dam’s presence necessitates ongoing monitoring and maintenance, roles that may be managed by local contacts like Tang Zhongping and Xiong Yue.

Tang Zhongping and Xiong Yue are listed as contacts for the Lantang Group, suggesting formal or informal roles in community liaison, administrative coordination, or infrastructure oversight. The presence of contact information indicates that these individuals may serve as points of communication for local governance, emergency response, or operational management related to the weir dam or other village functions. Chen Guozhong is also listed in connection with the Lantang Group, though without contact details, limiting the ability to assess their current role. The concentration of named individuals with contact data in a single hamlet implies a structured approach to local management, possibly aligned with rural governance frameworks in China that delegate responsibilities to community-level representatives. This network of contacts enhances the resilience of local operations but also represents a potential vulnerability if communication channels fail.

This hierarchical structure is consistent with China’s rural administrative framework, where villages are governed under township (乡镇) oversight, which reports to the county level. The relationship between Guding Town and Majiang County is explicitly documented, confirming the chain of governance [Data: Relationships (606)]. Despite one source referencing 'Magang County,' this is likely a phonetic or transcription error, as 'Majiang County' is the officially recognized name and aligns with the correct geographic and administrative context. Guding Town’s inclusion of other villages, such as Baisha Village, further situates Daping Village within a broader administrative network. This hierarchy implies that infrastructure projects, emergency responses, and policy implementation in Daping Village are subject to oversight and resource allocation from higher administrative levels. The formal structure supports accountability and coordination but may also introduce delays in local decision-making, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios such as flood control or dam maintenance.
