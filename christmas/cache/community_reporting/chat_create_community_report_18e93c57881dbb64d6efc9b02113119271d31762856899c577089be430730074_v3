It provides standardized procedures for design flood analysis, ensuring consistency and scientific rigor in evaluating flood risks in mountainous areas. This standard is widely referenced in hydrological and engineering studies related to flood control and infrastructure planning. Its application supports decision-making in disaster mitigation and land-use planning, particularly in regions prone to flash floods.

It focuses specifically on risk and hazard identification, emphasizing the analysis of vulnerabilities and potential impacts of mountain floods. This supplementary document addresses gaps in the original standard by incorporating dynamic risk factors and evolving environmental conditions, thereby improving the responsiveness of flood assessment frameworks.
