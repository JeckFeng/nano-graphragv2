Several specific population groups—Lujiqiao, Lugu, Shuiluodong, Wengwei, Gubin, and Taitang—are identified as high-risk zones, indicating concentrated vulnerability within the village. These areas are under active monitoring for disaster mitigation, reflecting the urgency of emergency planning and infrastructure resilience. The village's repeated inclusion in official assessments highlights its strategic role in regional flood prevention policy and water resource management. Its high degree score (8) among entities underscores its central position in the network of relationships.

With a total capacity of 152,000 m³ and an average annual flow of 8.24 million m³, the reservoir represents a significant investment in sustainable urban water supply. Its development aligns with broader goals of improving water security in regions prone to environmental stress. The reservoir's location within Guyang Village ties it directly to flood risk management efforts, suggesting dual benefits in both water storage and flood mitigation. The project’s scale and purpose indicate long-term implications for public health and regional development.

These structures play a critical role in managing water levels during heavy rainfall or flash flood events, helping to protect vulnerable populations in designated high-risk zones. Their presence indicates a layered approach to flood mitigation, combining structural engineering with early warning systems. The dams are physically located within the village, as confirmed by direct relationships, and their operation likely supports the broader objectives of watershed stability. Future maintenance and performance monitoring will be essential to ensure their continued effectiveness.

These bridges serve dual purposes: enabling transportation connectivity and influencing river hydrology through their structural design, including documented obstruction ratios and morphological metrics. Their placement in a flood-prone area necessitates careful engineering to prevent blockage during high-flow events, which could otherwise increase flood risk downstream. The presence of detailed data on these bridges suggests a high level of technical oversight and integration into regional flood modeling efforts. Together, they represent the intersection of civil infrastructure and environmental risk management.
