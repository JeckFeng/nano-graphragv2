INERTIAL EXPLORER first processes Position and Orientation System (POS) data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GNSS sensors to generate precise trajectory information for the UAV platform. This corrected navigation data is then imported into TERRASOLID to accurately georeference the raw LiDAR point cloud, enabling reliable feature extraction and terrain modeling. The software integration supports advanced classification of ground and non-ground points—such as vegetation, buildings, and terrain—which is essential for generating digital elevation models (DEMs) and conducting corridor analyses. This sequential processing chain ensures that data errors from sensor drift or signal latency are minimized, resulting in high-fidelity outputs suitable for engineering and environmental applications. The Chinese description explicitly confirms that after解算 (computation) in Inertial Explorer, data flows into Terrasolid for further processing, highlighting a standardized operational procedure.

Spanning from 2025 to 2028, this project focuses on the 3D reconstruction of a small watershed area using UAV-based oblique photography and LiDAR data collection. It encompasses multiple sub-activities including the OBLIQUE PHOTOGRAPHY SURVEY, LASER POINT CLOUD DATA COLLECTION, and 720 DEGREE PANORAMIC DATA COLLECTION, all coordinated to produce a comprehensive digital representation of the terrain. The project’s scope includes not only data acquisition but also processing, modeling, and secure data management through defined protocols. Its adherence to the national technical standard CH/T3026-2023 ensures methodological rigor and consistency in output quality. Furthermore, the project’s outputs are intended for hydrological hazard zone mapping and prevention planning, indicating its importance in risk mitigation and environmental management. As the hub connecting all other entities—from UAV platforms to software tools and data formats—this project represents the core operational and strategic focus of the entire community [Data: Entities (143), Relationships (156, 145, 161, 152, 154, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Use of FlyMap VIO UAV for multi-sensor data acquisition\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The FLYING FISH VIO UAV (also referred to as FlyMap VIO UAV) is the primary airborne platform used for data collection in this project, serving dual roles in both oblique photography and LiDAR-based terrain mapping. Manufactured by FlyMap (Fimapper), this UAV is equipped with sensors including a LiDAR system (identified as 激光雷达) to enable high-precision elevation data capture, particularly in areas where photogrammetry may be limited—such as gullies, dense vegetation, or shadowed regions. The UAV operates at a relative flight height of 100 meters and covers approximately 2.7 km², enabling consistent spatial resolution across the target watershed. It conducts both the OBLIQUE PHOTOGRAPHY SURVEY and LASER POINT CLOUD DATA COLLECTION, making it a critical node in the data acquisition phase. Its integration with INERTIAL EXPLORER for POS data processing ensures that all collected imagery and point clouds are accurately georeferenced. The relationship between the UAV and its payloads (e.g., laser radar) is explicitly defined, confirming a structured hardware configuration designed for professional-grade surveying. This versatility and reliability make the FlyMap VIO UAV a foundational asset in achieving comprehensive and accurate 3D terrain models [Data: Entities (131, 153, 152), Relationships (146, 147, 164, 47, 165, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Compliance with national technical standard CH/T3026-2023\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The project strictly adheres to CH/T3026-2023, a national technical regulation titled 'Technical Specifications for Oblique Photogrammetry of Real 3D Data,' published by the national surveying and mapping authority. This standard provides methodological guidelines for aerial photography, image acquisition parameters, data processing workflows, and quality control measures necessary for producing accurate and interoperable 3D models. By following this regulation, the project ensures that its outputs meet nationally recognized benchmarks for geometric accuracy, texture fidelity, and metadata completeness. Compliance enhances the credibility and usability of the 3D models for integration into government GIS systems, urban planning databases, and disaster risk management platforms. The regulation’s application governs key aspects such as flight planning, camera orientation, ground control point deployment, and triangulation accuracy—all of which contribute to the final model’s reliability. Given the project’s focus on hydrological hazard mapping, adherence to this standard is essential for legal validity and operational effectiveness in public safety initiatives. This regulatory alignment demonstrates a commitment to professional standards and institutional accountability in geospatial data production [Data: Entities (130), Relationships (145, 156, 150, 163, 162, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"End-to-end 3D modeling workflow from data to delivery\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The project follows a structured digital workflow that progresses from raw data acquisition to final 3D model delivery, involving multiple specialized stages and software tools. After UAV-based data collection (including oblique images and LiDAR point clouds), the data enters preprocessing and aerial triangulation using Smart 3D software—a fully automated platform capable of multi-node parallel processing for efficiency. This stage generates a 3D TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) mesh and applies textures derived from multi-view imagery, producing a realistic visual representation of the terrain. The resulting model then undergoes post-processing to correct defects such as water surface gaps, holes in vegetated areas, and floating artifacts, improving both geometric and visual accuracy. These refinement steps are crucial for applications in hydrological modeling, where surface continuity affects flow simulation. Finally, the completed 3D model is exported in SGB format—a compact, scalable 3D tile format optimized for storage, transmission, and visualization in GIS environments. This end-to-end pipeline ensures high-quality, standardized outputs suitable for long-term use in environmental monitoring and infrastructure planning [Data: Entities (132, 147, 148, 149), Relationships (150, 163, 162, 153, 154, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Robust data security through structured backup protocols\",\n            \"explanation\": \"To ensure data integrity and confidentiality, the project implements a formal DATA BACKUP AND STORAGE PROCEDURE requiring dual backups of all aerial data on separate mobile hard drives, with independent management by different team members. This redundancy strategy mitigates the risk of data loss due to hardware failure, theft, or accidental deletion—common concerns in field-based geospatial operations. By distributing backup responsibilities, the protocol also introduces a level of access control and accountability, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized modifications or breaches. Given the large volume and high value of LiDAR and image datasets collected over the watershed, preserving data availability is critical for project continuity and long-term archival. The procedure is formally linked to the AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND 3D MODELING PROJECT, indicating it is not an ad hoc measure but an integral part of the operational framework. This emphasis on data security aligns with best practices in scientific research and government-funded surveying projects, where data provenance and preservation are key compliance requirements.
