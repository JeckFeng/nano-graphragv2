These data layers are geometrically referenced to the central meridian at 108°E and are built upon foundational datasets such as 0.5m satellite imagery and 12.5m DEM. Specific data files, including '贵州省洞庭湖水系重安江001_原始激光数据.LAS' and '贵州省洞庭湖水系重安江001_地表数据.LAS', represent concrete instances of data deliverables.
