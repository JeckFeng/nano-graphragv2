This date is central to the coordination of field operations, serving as a reference point for scheduling, resource allocation, and data synchronization. Its high degree (2) reflects its role as a connector between time and operational activities. The precision in dating suggests a structured scientific or engineering workflow, possibly part of environmental monitoring or disaster risk assessment.

This simultaneous initiation implies an integrated field methodology where physical evidence of past flooding (e.g., water marks, debris lines) is being documented alongside topographic data. Such integration enhances the accuracy of hydrological reconstructions, particularly in gully or watershed studies. The entity has a degree of 2, indicating its direct connection to the start date and the broader measurement campaign.

This synchronization suggests a well-planned scientific protocol where different data types are collected under consistent environmental and temporal conditions. The combined degree of 4 in the relationship highlights the strength of the connection between these entities and their shared importance in the project.
