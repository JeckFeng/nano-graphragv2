The province's complex terrain—characterized by mountainous and hilly landscapes—makes it highly susceptible to flash floods, especially during periods of intense rainfall. This vulnerability has driven the development of extensive technical and institutional mechanisms to assess, monitor, and mitigate flood risks across small watersheds such as Chong'an River, Gedangzhai River, and Xiao Liuyu Basin. Guizhou’s role extends beyond local governance; it contributes critical hydrological data and field practices that inform broader regional strategies, particularly in relation to the Dongting Lake water system, which receives runoff from these upstream basins. The province's active participation in national water security underscores its systemic importance in China’s disaster prevention architecture.

Developed by the Guizhou Provincial Water Resources Department, this plan outlines a multi-faceted approach to enhancing monitoring, early warning, emergency response, and engineering interventions. It integrates both structural measures—such as the construction of check dams and channel reinforcements—and non-structural strategies like public education campaigns and evacuation drills. The plan emphasizes real-time data acquisition through expanded networks of rain gauges and water level sensors, aiming to improve the timeliness and accuracy of flood warnings at the township and village levels. By aligning with national technical standards and incorporating trial-stage guidelines, the plan reflects a dynamic, adaptive framework responsive to evolving climate threats. Its implementation directly influences public safety and infrastructure resilience across high-risk counties like Majiang County in Qiandongnan Prefecture.

Central to this structure is SL 767-2018, the national industry standard titled 'Technical Specification for Flash Flood Disaster Investigation and Evaluation', which provides a foundational methodology for surveying and assessing flash flood risks. This standard informs the development and execution of Guizhou’s 2025 implementation plan, ensuring consistency with national protocols. Complementing this are trial versions of technical requirements, such as the 'Technical Requirements for Risk Hazard Investigation and Impact Analysis in Flash Flood Disasters (Trial)', which offer updated guidance on identifying vulnerabilities and analyzing downstream impacts. These trial documents are being piloted in Guizhou, reflecting the province’s role as a testing ground for next-generation risk assessment tools. The coexistence and integration of these specifications demonstrate a maturing technical ecosystem that balances regulatory rigor with innovation.

This manual operationalizes theoretical hydrological models—such as the rational method and Manning’s equation—into practical procedures tailored to Guizhou’s unique topography and rainfall patterns. It provides standardized approaches for estimating peak flows in small watersheds using observed rainfall data, channel cross-sections, and land use parameters. This enables consistent flood frequency analysis across different regions of the province, supporting the design of flood control infrastructure and the delineation of inundation zones. The manual is closely aligned with the 2025 implementation plan and draws upon national standards, while also accommodating local empirical adjustments. Its widespread use ensures that technical outputs are both scientifically sound and administratively actionable.

Due to the rapid runoff characteristics of steep terrain, traditional large-basin models are often inadequate for early warning purposes. Therefore, the system relies heavily on granular data from small catchments, including rainfall records from localized gauges, channel geometry measurements, and remote sensing inputs such as LiDAR point clouds and oblique aerial imagery. These data support the creation of high-resolution flood inundation maps and the calibration of hydrodynamic models. The 2025 implementation plan mandates systematic data collection and submission from these small basins, ensuring a continuous feedback loop between field observation and model refinement. This focus enhances the precision of flood forecasting and strengthens the scientific basis for evacuation decisions and land use planning.

Several rivers originating in or flowing through Guizhou—including the Chong'an River and Gedangzhai River—contribute to the upper reaches of the Dongting Lake system. As such, land use changes, soil erosion, and flood events in Guizhou can have downstream consequences for water levels, sedimentation, and flood risks in Hunan. Recognizing this interdependence, Guizhou has integrated its flood prevention activities into broader basin-wide cooperation mechanisms. By improving runoff regulation and reducing peak flows through watershed management and early warning systems, Guizhou contributes to regional water security. This transboundary function elevates the strategic importance of Guizhou’s flood control initiatives, positioning them as essential components of inter-provincial disaster risk reduction efforts.
