It is described as having a measured flood mark elevation of 823.59 m, a surface slope of 2.85%, and a peak flow of 376 m³/s at the flood mark location. This event serves as the primary subject of analysis, with physical and computational methods used to reconstruct its magnitude and behavior. The flood’s occurrence on the Gedangzhai River is directly supported by evidence from flood marks observed along the river’s course.

This location provides empirical evidence that supports hydraulic reconstructions of the event, serving as a fixed reference point for measurements and modeling efforts. Its relationship to the 1996 flood is direct and evidentiary, anchoring the theoretical calculations to observable data.

This datum is essential for topographic and hydraulic modeling, allowing analysts to determine water surface profiles and gradients during the flood.

This use of empirical modeling illustrates how theoretical equations are used to extrapolate flow conditions from limited field data. The application of such formulas enhances understanding of past flood behavior, enabling better predictions and risk assessments for future events.
