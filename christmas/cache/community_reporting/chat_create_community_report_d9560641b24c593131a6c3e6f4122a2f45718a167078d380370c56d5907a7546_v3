Its role in channeling water from various sources makes it critical to regional flow and flood analysis. The river's high degree score (5) reflects its extensive connectivity within the system, indicating its structural importance.

The event is explicitly tied to GEDANGZAIHE as the central recipient, highlighting its vulnerability during peak inflow periods.
