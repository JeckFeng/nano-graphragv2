The village lies within a high-risk watershed and is associated with the Dapu Group landslide, indicating geological instability that compounds flood risks. Its designation as a site for monitoring point GDZ8 highlights its role in collecting critical hydrological data used for flood discharge calculations and early warning systems across the region. This monitoring function underscores Huangni Village’s strategic importance in managing water flow dynamics and disaster preparedness. The integration of the village into formal flood risk assessment frameworks reflects its dual status as both a vulnerable settlement and a key contributor to regional safety infrastructure.

This dam is formally listed in the flood prevention registry, indicating its recognition as a key component of regional disaster management. The dam’s location near the Gedangzhai River enables it to regulate downstream water levels, particularly during periods of intense rainfall or rapid runoff, thereby protecting downstream settlements, including those in Huangni Village. The structure is part of a broader flood control system that includes monitoring and emergency planning coordinated at the town level. Its association with the Gedangzhai Group and administrative oversight by Guodong Town further emphasize its integrated function within the watershed’s risk management network. As such, the Basha Village concrete dam is not only a local infrastructure asset but also a critical node in inter-village flood resilience.

The shared hydrological system—centered on the Gedangzhai River—means that upstream events such as dam releases or heavy rainfall can simultaneously impact multiple settlements across both villages. This interconnected risk necessitates a unified approach to monitoring, early warning, and infrastructure management. The administrative oversight provided by Guodong Town enables coordination between these villages, allowing for integrated flood response strategies. The presence of multiple residential groups—such as Da Po, Tian Kan, Xin Zhuang, Gedangzhai Group, and Bay Village—amplifies the potential human impact of flooding, making community-wide preparedness essential.

For instance, the Tian Kan Group in Huangni Village has a recorded population of 73 and is specifically noted as being in a flood-prone area near the river, making it highly susceptible to rapid-onset flooding. Similarly, the Xin Zhuang Group is identified in flood risk assessments as part of the riverine settlement system, indicating its exposure to seasonal and emergency hydrological events. In Basha Village, the Gedangzhai Group and Bay Village Group are linked to flood control infrastructure, suggesting that their locations necessitate engineered protections. The decentralized nature of these hamlets complicates evacuation planning and emergency response, as access routes—such as bridges—may be compromised during flood events. Understanding the spatial distribution and demographic characteristics of these subgroups is essential for targeted risk reduction and resilience building.

It flows through Huangni Village and is regulated by the concrete dam in Basha Village, forming the backbone of the region’s water management system. The river poses a direct flash flood risk to multiple residential groups, particularly during periods of high discharge, and its behavior is monitored at point GDZ8 in Huangni Village to support predictive modeling. Infrastructure such as Gedangzhai River Bridge 01 serves both transportation and risk monitoring purposes, linking the Da Po Group to other areas while also functioning as a point of observation for water levels. The river’s role in both hazard and infrastructure underscores its dual nature: it is a lifeline for the region but also a source of recurring danger. Effective management of the river’s dynamics is therefore critical to the safety and stability of all downstream communities.

This administrative integration allows for consistent risk communication, emergency drills, and resource allocation across multiple settlements. The inclusion of both villages in the flash flood prevention list reflects a top-down recognition of shared vulnerabilities and the need for coordinated mitigation strategies. By unifying disparate hamlets under a single governance structure, Guodong Town enhances the region’s capacity to respond to hydrological emergencies and implement long-term resilience measures. This governance framework is essential for managing the complex interdependencies between natural hazards, human settlements, and engineered infrastructure.
