These 11 zones are newly classified flash flood hazard areas, indicating a high level of environmental vulnerability and a critical need for intervention. The town’s role in the flood risk survey highlights its status as a priority for monitoring, emergency planning, and mitigation infrastructure. Given that all of its identified hazard zones are designated prevention targets, Gutong Town represents a convergence of risk and response efforts, making it a key area for disaster resilience initiatives. The field surveys conducted in the area were part of a broader strategy to enhance public safety in flood-prone areas of Majiang County, emphasizing community-level preparedness and engineering solutions.

These geomorphic features accelerate water flow during heavy rainfall, reducing response time and increasing the likelihood of overbank flooding. SHARP CHANNEL BENDS are recognized as natural hazard amplifiers, particularly in small watersheds like Chonganjiang 001, where topography can rapidly escalate flood conditions. The identification of these bends in both Gutong Town and Xingshan Street suggests a regional hydrological vulnerability pattern, but Gutong Town bears a disproportionate share of the risk. These features are likely contributing factors to the designation of multiple flood prevention targets in the area, necessitating targeted engineering controls such as flow deflectors or channel reinforcements.

This adds a secondary geotechnical risk dimension to the flood vulnerability profile of the area, as saturated soils during flood events can reactivate landslides or trigger new slope failures. The co-location of flood and landslide risks in Dapu Group increases the complexity of disaster planning, requiring integrated early warning systems and evacuation protocols that address multiple hazard types. While the landslide is noted as historical, its presence indicates underlying instability that may be exacerbated by increased precipitation or river erosion linked to climate variability. The inclusion of this site in the broader flood risk survey underscores the holistic approach taken in assessing community vulnerability.

The investigation involved comprehensive field assessments to evaluate risks to population, infrastructure, and environmental stability. Its findings directly inform mitigation strategies, including early warning systems, land-use planning, and public awareness campaigns. The survey's outcomes have elevated Gutong Town's status as a high-priority area for investment in resilience infrastructure. The data collected also supports modeling and simulation efforts aimed at predicting flood behavior under various scenarios.

It serves as the central channel through which flood risks propagate, particularly in areas like Gutong Town where topographic and geomorphic features amplify danger. The L3 DATA FOUNDATION includes 3D modeling and cross-section measurements of the river system, enabling precise flood simulation and infrastructure planning. This high-resolution data supports the identification of hazard zones and informs engineering interventions to manage flow and reduce inundation risks.

Gutong Town is not only the administrative hub with the highest concentration of flood prevention targets but also contains localized geotechnical vulnerabilities such as those in Dapu Group. The interaction between sharp channel bends and high-flow events can lead to rapid flooding, while saturated ground conditions may destabilize slopes with prior landslide activity. This convergence of hazards demands a multi-hazard mitigation strategy that goes beyond traditional flood defenses. Coordinated efforts involving hydrological modeling, slope monitoring, and community engagement are essential to reduce overall risk. The integration of these factors into a single assessment framework highlights the sophistication of the regional disaster preparedness approach.
