It serves as a formal measurement site for water levels, discharge rates, and flood behavior, providing essential data for long-term watershed analysis and engineering design. The site recorded a peak flow of 376 m³/s during the 1996 flood, which stands as a historical benchmark for flood modeling. Additionally, GDZ46 is associated with a 2% annual exceedance probability (AEP) design flood of 387 m³/s, underscoring its importance in flood protection infrastructure planning. Its high degree centrality (8) and multiple interconnections reflect its pivotal role in the network. The data collected here inform regulatory decisions, climate impact studies, and operational flood forecasting, making GDZ46 indispensable to regional water resource management [Data: Entities (339); Relationships (459, 460, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The 1996 flood as a benchmark event\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 1996 flood is a significant historical event in the Ge'dangzhai River system, documented through instrumental measurements at GDZ46 and corroborated by eyewitness testimony. The flood reached a peak discharge of 376 m³/s and a high water mark of 823.59m elevation, both of which are critical inputs for hydrological model calibration. This event is consistently referenced as larger in magnitude than the 2014 flood, based on accounts from local resident Z-AGE, who described it as having submerged backyard areas in Xiaozhai. The 1996 flood serves as a key reference for determining design flood values and assessing infrastructure resilience, particularly for projects requiring 2% AEP flood standards. Its documented impact and data reliability make it a cornerstone of flood risk assessment in the region [Data: Entities (357); Relationships (459, 465, 466)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Role of tributary control sections GDZA4X and GDZB4\",\n            \"explanation\": \"GDZA4X and GDZB4 are secondary but vital hydrological control sections located on tributaries of the Ge'dangzhai River system. GDZA4X is situated on the Gulbin Stream at Shuiluodong, within a 5.98 km² watershed, and features a channel slope of 9.94‰, contributing to rapid runoff and flood routing dynamics. It supports water surface profile calculations and is integrated into broader hydrological models. Similarly, GDZB4 is located on the Wengwei River in Wengwei Village, with a watershed area of 8.23 km² and a steeper channel slope of 11.06‰, indicating high flow velocity potential during storm events. Both sites are used in technical assessments for drainage planning, floodplain mapping, and hydraulic structure design. Their placement on tributaries allows for the disaggregation of flow contributions upstream of the main river confluence, enhancing the accuracy of basin-wide models. These control points are essential for understanding cumulative flood risks and validating regional hydrological simulations [Data: Entities (361, 360); Relationships (468, 467)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integration of local eyewitness testimony in flood analysis\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Eyewitness accounts from local residents, particularly Z-AGE of Xiaozhai, play a supporting role in validating hydrological data and contextualizing historical flood events. Z-AGE, a 58-year-old villager, provided comparative descriptions of the 1996 and 2014 floods, emphasizing that the 1996 event was significantly more severe, with visible submersion of residential backyards. This qualitative data complements instrumental records by confirming the spatial extent and societal impact of past floods, especially in areas where physical markers may be absent. The 2014 flood, in contrast, lacked identifiable high water marks, making eyewitness input even more valuable for relative severity assessment. These accounts are formally referenced in hydrological studies, demonstrating the integration of community knowledge into scientific and engineering practices. The combination of empirical data and local observation strengthens the credibility and comprehensiveness of flood risk models [Data: Entities (359, 358); Relationships (465, 466)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Downstream monitoring at GDZ Downstream 1 in Sanlian Village\",\n            \"explanation\": \"GDZ Downstream 1 is a hydrological control section located in Sanlian Village, positioned after the confluence of the Ge'dangzhai River and Xibu River. This site enables the monitoring of integrated flow dynamics from upstream tributaries and mainstem contributions, providing critical post-confluence data for flood routing and water surface profiling. As a downstream reference point, it helps assess how flood waves propagate through the river system and how cumulative discharge affects lower-elevation communities. Sanlian Village’s hosting of this control section underscores its exposure to flood risks and its importance in regional monitoring networks. Data from GDZ Downstream 1 are likely used to validate model outputs derived from upstream measurements at GDZ46 and tributary sites, ensuring consistency across the basin. This downstream perspective is essential for emergency preparedness and flood warning systems in vulnerable settlements [Data: Entities (363, 366); Relationships (469)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Geographic and administrative linkages between control sections and local settlements\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Each hydrological control section is closely tied to a specific local settlement, reflecting the integration of scientific monitoring with community geography.

Similarly, GDZB4 is associated with Wenguoguo Group (Wengwei Group), located within the Wengwei River catchment. These linkages demonstrate that hydrological monitoring is not abstract but embedded within local administrative and residential frameworks. The alignment of technical infrastructure with village boundaries facilitates community engagement, data accessibility, and localized risk communication.
