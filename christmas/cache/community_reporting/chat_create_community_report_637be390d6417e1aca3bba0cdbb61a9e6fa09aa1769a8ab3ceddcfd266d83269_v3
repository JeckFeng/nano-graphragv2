Its connection to the GEDANGZAIHE river further underscores its environmental context, particularly in relation to water systems and potential geological hazards.

Notably, Gutong Town is the site of a historical riverbank landslide, which raises concerns about infrastructure resilience and community safety. The presence of such geological risks within a populated administrative zone suggests the need for monitoring and potential mitigation efforts. With a degree of 3, Gutong Town is a well-connected node in the network, linking both human settlements and environmental data.

Dapo Group is explicitly identified as the location where this geological event occurred, indicating a localized risk to residents and infrastructure. The hierarchical relationship—Dapo Group within Huangni Village, which is within Gutong Town—demonstrates a nested settlement pattern vulnerable to environmental hazards. Given that these are inhabited areas, the historical landslide suggests potential for future instability, especially if triggered by heavy rainfall or river erosion.

Its presence contributes to the local economy and indicates some level of industrial activity in the region. However, no direct relationship is established between this plant and the landslide-affected areas, though its geographic proximity within the same county means it could be indirectly affected by regional environmental events.

Its placement within the county suggests it may influence local hydrology, agriculture, and settlement patterns. Given that the documented landslide occurred along a riverbank in Huangni Village, it is plausible that the GEDANGZAIHE river contributes to erosion or slope instability in the area. While no explicit link is made between the river and the landslide in the provided data, the co-location of a river and a riverbank landslide implies a potential causal or contributing relationship.
