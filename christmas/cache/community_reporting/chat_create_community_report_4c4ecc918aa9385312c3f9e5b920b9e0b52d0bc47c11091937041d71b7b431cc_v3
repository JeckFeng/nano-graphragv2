It operates at the intersection of field observation, geographic information systems (GIS), and historical documentation, aiming to identify past maximum water levels in river basins. The investigation's primary objective is to support flood risk assessment and disaster mitigation planning by providing empirical data on the extent, depth, and velocity of historical floods. This data is particularly crucial in mountainous and rural areas where formal hydrological monitoring infrastructure may be lacking. By establishing flood markers—such as wall stains, sediment deposits, or fixed survey posts—in each administrative village, the investigation creates a spatially distributed dataset that enables regional-scale modeling of flood behavior. The systematic nature of the survey ensures consistency across locations and time, enhancing the reliability of risk maps and early warning systems. Furthermore, the integration of local knowledge through interviews with residents strengthens data validity and fosters community engagement in disaster resilience. The investigation’s outputs are foundational for infrastructure planning, emergency response protocols, and long-term climate adaptation strategies.

Each administrative village is required to host at least one designated flood mark point, which is used to record the highest historical water level based on physical traces and local memory. This village-level approach leverages existing administrative boundaries to streamline data collection, standardize methodology, and facilitate hierarchical data aggregation from the local to regional level. The use of administrative villages enables efficient coordination among local governments, water conservancy departments, and field survey teams, ensuring consistent application of technical guidelines. Additionally, it allows for the localization of flood risk information, making it directly relevant to community-level decision-making in land use, evacuation planning, and infrastructure development. By embedding the investigation within the established governance framework of administrative villages, the project enhances data accessibility and accountability. This structure also supports longitudinal monitoring, enabling future surveys to build upon prior records and detect changes in flood patterns over time.

This form captures essential information such as the location, elevation, identification code, and photographic documentation of each flood mark point. Its standardized format ensures data interoperability across different villages and survey teams, reducing variability and enhancing the reliability of aggregated analyses. The form serves as the official record for each observed flood trace and is essential for subsequent GIS mapping, hydraulic modeling, and archival storage. By centralizing data collection through this form, the investigation maintains a uniform quality control process, which is vital for producing credible flood hazard assessments. The use of the form also facilitates digitalization and long-term preservation of flood history, supporting future research and policy development. As a core component of the survey workflow, the 历史洪痕表 bridges field observation with technical analysis, ensuring that raw data is transformed into actionable scientific information.

This technical document outlines standardized protocols for identifying flood marks, collecting data, assessing risk zones, and analyzing the impacts of historical floods. As a trial version, it reflects an evolving set of best practices intended to improve the accuracy and consistency of flood risk assessments, particularly in regions vulnerable to flash floods. The document's role in guiding the 洪痕迹调查 ensures that field activities adhere to scientific and technical standards, enhancing the credibility and utility of the collected data. It also facilitates training for survey personnel and supports quality assurance across different jurisdictions. By institutionalizing a uniform approach, the technical requirements help harmonize data from diverse geographic areas, enabling comparative analysis and regional risk mapping.

Cross-sectional data, which includes elevation profiles perpendicular to river flow, is essential for estimating water depth, flow velocity, and inundation extent during historical flood events. By combining flood mark elevations with cross-sectional surveys, analysts can reconstruct flood hydrodynamics and simulate potential future scenarios. This integration enhances the scientific rigor of the investigation, transforming qualitative observations into quantitative inputs for flood modeling software. The combined use of these datasets allows for the delineation of high-risk zones (danger areas) with greater precision, supporting targeted mitigation measures such as embankment reinforcement or relocation planning. The relationship between the two activities suggests a coordinated watershed survey effort, where multiple data streams are synthesized to produce comprehensive flood risk assessments. This synergy underscores the interdisciplinary nature of modern disaster risk reduction, combining field geoscience, engineering, and data science.
