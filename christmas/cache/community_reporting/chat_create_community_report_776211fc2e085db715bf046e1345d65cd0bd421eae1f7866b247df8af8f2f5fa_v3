This calculation enables the modeling of water levels at various frequencies, which is essential for understanding flood dynamics and managing river systems. The high degree centrality (degree: 10) reflects its importance as a hub connecting multiple measurement points. The process is not only technical but also serves a functional role in environmental monitoring and disaster preparedness. By synthesizing data from control sections such as GDZ2, GDZ3, and others, it supports decision-making in water resource planning and emergency response.

Each of these entities has a degree of 2, reflecting their dual relationship: one connecting to the river itself and another linking to the WATER SURFACE PROFILE CALCULATION. These control points serve as critical data inputs, allowing for spatially distributed modeling of the river’s behavior. Their standardized naming convention suggests a systematic monitoring framework, likely part of a larger hydrological survey or flood management system. The consistency in their function indicates a well-organized infrastructure for environmental observation.

This indicates that the primary purpose of this technical process is flood risk assessment and hydrodynamic analysis. By leveraging data from control sections distributed along the river, the model can simulate how water levels change under different flow conditions, providing valuable insights for flood forecasting and infrastructure planning. Such modeling is crucial in regions prone to seasonal flooding or extreme weather events. The integration of field measurements with computational analysis underscores a data-driven approach to environmental management.

For example, GDZ2's results are explicitly tabulated as part of the calculation process (relationship 496), and similarly for GDZ3 (497), GDZ4 (498), and so on. This uniformity across all sections suggests a standardized protocol for data handling and reporting, ensuring consistency and reliability in hydrological assessments. Standardization is essential for comparing data across time and space, enabling accurate trend analysis and model validation. The systematic tabulation also facilitates integration into larger water management databases or reporting systems.

The inclusion of sub-sections like GDZ4-1 and GDZ5-1 suggests finer-grained monitoring in areas of particular interest, possibly due to confluences, bends, or infrastructure such as bridges or dams.
