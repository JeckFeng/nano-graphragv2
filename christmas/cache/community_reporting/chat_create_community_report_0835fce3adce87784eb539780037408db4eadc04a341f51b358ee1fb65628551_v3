It includes raw and classified LiDAR point cloud data, original images, DEM, and DOM with a ground resolution of 0.2 meters, covering 22.5 square kilometers of the Rengan River watershed. This level of spatial detail ensures high accuracy for topographic representation and supports advanced GIS applications including hydrological modeling and infrastructure design. The dataset is structured as a standardized deliverable, indicating its role as an authoritative source for downstream analysis and decision-making. Its inclusion of multiple data types highlights its function as an integrated geospatial foundation for multi-purpose use.

The DEM provides accurate elevation data generated using aerial triangulation and point cloud data from drone-based LiDAR, supporting applications such as slope analysis, flood simulation, and engineering cross-section extraction. The DOM offers high-resolution surface texture information corrected for geometric distortions, enabling precise visual interpretation and feature identification. Both products are produced at a 1:2000 scale, ensuring compatibility with large-scale mapping and planning tasks. Their joint production emphasizes a synergistic workflow where elevation and imagery data are processed in parallel to maximize analytical utility.

Specifically, it serves as the source of texture information used in the creation and rendering of oblique or tilt photogrammetry models, improving their visual fidelity and realism. This integration allows for immersive spatial analysis, particularly useful in urban planning and disaster scenario simulations where visual context is essential. The use of DOM in this capacity underscores its value beyond 2D mapping, extending into advanced visualization environments. This functional linkage demonstrates how foundational datasets are repurposed for next-generation geospatial applications.

The 飞马 VI0 system serves a similar function, acquiring both imagery and LiDAR point clouds, and is used in conjunction with the D20 system in the same project context, indicating a multi-platform approach to data collection. This redundancy or complementarity enhances data coverage and accuracy. The use of drone-based systems reflects a modern, efficient method for geospatial data acquisition, reducing costs and logistical complexity compared to traditional airborne surveys.

This projection framework minimizes distortion over the area of interest and aligns with regional or national mapping standards, facilitating integration with other geospatial data layers. The use of a defined central meridian indicates adherence to a formal cartographic system, likely part of a larger national grid (e.g., China's CGCS2000 with zone-based UTM or Gauss-Kruger projections). This standardization is essential for applications requiring precise spatial alignment, such as cross-boundary environmental monitoring or infrastructure development.

These are used to produce DEM and DOM, which are then compiled into the L2 DATA BASEPLATE. This structured pipeline ensures data provenance, quality control, and standardization. The entire process is georeferenced to a consistent coordinate framework (central meridian 108°E), ensuring seamless integration. Such a workflow is typical in modern surveying projects requiring high-accuracy geospatial outputs for government, environmental, or engineering use.
