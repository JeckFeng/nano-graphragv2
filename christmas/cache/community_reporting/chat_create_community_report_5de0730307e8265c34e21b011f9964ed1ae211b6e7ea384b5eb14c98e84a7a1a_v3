This investigation encompasses the identification and evaluation of protected objects—such as城集镇沿河村落, 重要经济活动区, and 旅游景区—as well as risk隐患 including跨沟路段, 塘堰坝, and沟道束窄. Its broad scope reflects a comprehensive strategy for disaster risk reduction in mountainous and riverine areas prone to flash flooding. The investigation integrates remote sensing, field surveys, and community input to build an accurate picture of potential hazards and exposure. By coordinating with local administrative bodies like村委会 and居委会, it ensures data relevance and operational feasibility for emergency planning. This central role underscores its function as the backbone of regional flood resilience efforts.

These zones are determined through hydrological modeling, terrain analysis, and historical disaster data, and they serve as the primary focus for monitoring, early warning systems, and evacuation planning. Entities such as跨沟路段, 跨沟桥涵, 塘堰坝, and低洼地 are specifically mapped within these zones due to their susceptibility to flood impacts. The presence of居民户 and经济活动区 within危险区 further amplifies the potential consequences of failure or inundation. Field verification is required to validate zone boundaries and ensure alignment with actual settlement patterns and topography. This rigorous approach enables targeted interventions and resource allocation during flood seasons.

These structures can fail during intense rainfall events, either due to overtopping, scour, or structural fatigue, triggering secondary disasters such as upstream flooding or downstream debris surges. For example, unstable塘堰坝 may collapse and release sudden flood pulses into downstream危险区, endangering居民和安置点. Similarly,桥涵的过流能力不足可能导致沟道束窄, exacerbating water level rise and increasing the likelihood of漫溢. These risks necessitate regular safety evaluations and integration into early warning systems. Their inclusion in the调查 process ensures that engineering resilience measures are prioritized.

These households are often located in low-elevation or valley-adjacent areas that are naturally susceptible to flooding. The调查 requires high-resolution imaging of homes (minimum 1024x768 pixels) to document exposure levels and support post-disaster damage assessment. Urban and rural settlements such as城集镇沿河村落 are especially concerning due to higher population density and limited escape routes during rapid-onset events like泥石流. Special attention is given to ensuring that emergency plans include verified转移路线 and安置点 accessible to these communities. The involvement of基层组织 like村委会 and居委会 ensures local knowledge informs planning accuracy. This human-centered focus reflects the priority on life-saving outcomes in disaster management.

These features are not only standalone risks but also interact dynamically with other entities such as沟道束窄 and塘堰坝—landslides can block channels, creating temporary dams that later breach catastrophically. The requirement for 720-degree panoramic data collection at these sites indicates a high level of monitoring intensity, aimed at capturing detailed topographic and structural conditions for predictive modeling. Their classification under both隐患要素 and protected对象 highlights the dual challenge of mitigating geohazards while protecting nearby populations. Field复核 by村委会 ensures that local observations supplement technical data, improving the reliability of risk assessments. Addressing these points is essential for preventing cascading disasters during extreme weather events.

These organizations are responsible for verifying critical safety infrastructure such as转移路线 and安置点, confirming their accessibility and capacity during crisis scenarios. They also provide authoritative input on the location and status of地质灾害点, leveraging community-based knowledge that complements technical surveys. In urban settings,居委会 facilitates surveys of重要城(集)镇居民户, ensuring coverage of densely populated zones. Their participation strengthens the legitimacy and accuracy of collected data, bridging institutional planning with on-the-ground realities.

For example,沟道束窄 observed in imagery must be confirmed through field inspection to determine if it significantly constricts flow and increases flood risk. Data collected includes geospatial coordinates, photographs, and structural conditions, forming a digital inventory for GIS-based risk modeling. This integration of technologies enables scalable, repeatable surveys across large watersheds while maintaining local accuracy. The process supports dynamic updates to危险区 maps and informs engineering mitigation strategies.
