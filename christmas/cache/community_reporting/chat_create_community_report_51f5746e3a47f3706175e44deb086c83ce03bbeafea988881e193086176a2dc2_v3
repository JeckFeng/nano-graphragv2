The high degree score of 17 indicates its centrality within the network, reflecting its role in integrating multiple data collection activities and stakeholder inputs. This investigation is not merely observational but involves active field verification, data acquisition, and coordination with local flood control personnel to ensure accuracy and responsiveness. Its broad scope underscores its importance in regional disaster prevention and emergency planning efforts.

It arises from intense rainfall that mobilizes loose soil and rock, leading to rapid and destructive flows down slopes and channels. The relationship between 山洪灾害隐患调查 and 泥石流 highlights the integration of geological hazard assessments into broader flood risk management strategies. Given its destructive potential, understanding the source, flow path, and deposition zones of mudslides is essential for accurate risk zoning and early warning systems. Historical patterns, topography, and land cover are critical factors in predicting mudslide occurrences, making this an integral part of the survey’s analytical framework.

Their inclusion in the investigation reflects a proactive approach to safeguarding connectivity and public safety during disasters. Similarly, 塘堰坝 (small check dams) and 沟道束 (channel constrictions) can exacerbate flooding by impeding water flow or failing under pressure, turning them from protective structures into potential hazard sources. Field verification of their condition and capacity is thus a critical aspect of the survey.

The survey mandates on-site data collection and registration of these entities to assess exposure levels and develop targeted mitigation plans, including evacuation protocols and emergency communication systems.
