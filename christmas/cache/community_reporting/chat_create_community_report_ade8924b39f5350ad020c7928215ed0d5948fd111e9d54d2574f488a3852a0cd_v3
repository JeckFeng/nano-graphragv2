It encompasses multiple watersheds, including the Rengan River and Chongan River, and plays a crucial role in regional water management, groundwater recharge, and ecological sustainability. Despite its name, it does not directly connect to the main Dongting Lake but shares hydrological characteristics and nomenclature. The system supports agricultural irrigation and rural communities, making it vital for sustainable development in the region. Ongoing research and monitoring aim to assess its response to climate variability and land use changes, underscoring its importance in environmental planning.

Its size and topography make it representative of small mountainous basins prone to flash flooding, necessitating advanced monitoring systems. The watershed is specifically targeted by both the L1 and L3 Data Baseplates, which provide high-resolution terrain and surface data essential for accurate modeling. Additionally, the real-time dynamic warning system for mountain floods is applied here, using short-term rainfall forecasts and soil moisture data to issue timely alerts. This concentration of monitoring and modeling infrastructure highlights the Rengan River's strategic importance in regional disaster preparedness.

The L1 Data Baseplate provides 0.5-meter resolution satellite imagery and a 12.5-meter digital elevation model (DEM), offering detailed topographic information critical for hydrological modeling. The L3 Data Baseplate enhances this with oblique photography and 3D oblique models, enabling more accurate visualization of surface features and urban-rural landscapes. These data layers are essential inputs for the distributed hydrological model and the real-time flood warning system, improving the precision of runoff simulations and flood risk assessments. The dedicated development of these products for the Rengan River underscores the investment in localized, high-fidelity monitoring infrastructure.

By integrating data from the L1 and L3 baseplates and leveraging the distributed hydrological model, the system can simulate rainfall-runoff processes with high temporal resolution. This capability allows local authorities to issue timely warnings to vulnerable communities, potentially reducing loss of life and property.

It is employed as the core analytical engine within the Real-Time Dynamic Warning System for Mountain Floods, enabling spatially explicit predictions across the Rengan River watershed. Unlike lumped models that treat a watershed as a single unit, this distributed approach allows for more accurate representation of variable terrain, land cover, and hydrological behavior across sub-basins. This enhances the system's ability to predict localized flood events with greater precision. The model’s integration into operational warning systems demonstrates its practical utility in real-world disaster management scenarios, particularly in data-scarce, mountainous regions like Guizhou.
