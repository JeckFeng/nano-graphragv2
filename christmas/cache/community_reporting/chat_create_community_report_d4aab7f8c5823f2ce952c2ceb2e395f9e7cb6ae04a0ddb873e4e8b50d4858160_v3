It functions as a key node for local governance, responsible for managing community development, infrastructure, and emergency preparedness. The street oversees several population centers and critical infrastructure, positioning it as a central entity in regional planning and disaster response coordination. Notably, Xingshan Street is marked by significant environmental vulnerabilities, particularly related to flooding, which influences its administrative priorities. With seven identified dangerous flood risk zones—five historical and two newly recognized—the area demands sustained monitoring and mitigation efforts. These risks directly affect community safety and infrastructure integrity, making Xingshan Street a focal point for resilience planning in the face of climate-related hazards.

It contains five specific population groups categorized as flash flood risk areas, indicating a high concentration of vulnerable residents within a small geographic area. These groups are likely situated in low-lying or poorly drained zones, increasing their exposure during heavy rainfall or river overflow events. As a subordinate unit under Xingshan Street’s administrative authority, Guyang Village relies on higher-level governance for disaster planning, early warning systems, and emergency response. The existence of multiple at-risk population clusters within the village underscores the need for targeted risk communication and evacuation planning. Given that flash floods can occur with little warning and cause significant damage, the presence of these vulnerable groups elevates the overall threat level within the community.

These structures are part of a chain of riverine infrastructure designed to manage hydrological dynamics in the area. While they may serve purposes such as irrigation, sediment control, or minor hydropower, their presence can also influence downstream flood risks, particularly if maintenance is inadequate or during periods of extreme rainfall. The structural similarity of these weirs to others in the region suggests standardized design and potentially uniform performance under stress conditions. However, any failure or overtopping of these dams could exacerbate flooding in already vulnerable zones, especially in the five flash flood risk groups within Guyang Village. Therefore, the condition and operational status of these weirs are critical factors in overall flood risk assessment.

While Bridge 03 has minimal water-blocking impact, Bridge 04 has a measured water-blocking area ratio of 12.06%, which could contribute to localized impoundment and altered flow dynamics during high water events. Even moderate obstruction from bridges can lead to upstream water accumulation, increasing flood risk in adjacent areas, particularly during storm surges or rapid snowmelt. The presence of impoundment volume associated with Bridge 04 suggests that it may act as a partial barrier, potentially worsening flood conditions in nearby population groups. These bridges fall under the administrative jurisdiction of Xingshan Street, meaning local authorities are responsible for ensuring their structural integrity and hydraulic efficiency. Regular assessment of bridge hydraulics is essential, especially in light of the area’s existing flood vulnerabilities.

The persistence of historical flood zones indicates long-standing hydrological or infrastructural deficiencies that have not been fully mitigated, possibly due to geographical constraints or limited resources. The emergence of two additional risk areas suggests that environmental conditions are evolving—potentially due to climate change, land use changes, or degradation of drainage systems. These new zones may not yet be fully integrated into existing disaster response plans, increasing the risk of unanticipated impacts during flood events. The combination of established and emerging threats requires adaptive management strategies, including updated flood modeling, expanded early warning coverage, and community engagement. The integration of both types of zones within the same administrative area amplifies the overall risk profile and necessitates comprehensive, data-driven planning.

Any delays or inefficiencies in decision-making at the street level could directly impact the safety of the five flash flood risk population groups within Guyang Village. The governance model supports coordinated planning but also creates a single point of responsibility, making it essential that Xingshan Street maintains robust emergency protocols and sufficient resources.

For instance, poor maintenance of weir dams could increase upstream pressure, while obstructive bridge designs could worsen downstream flooding.
