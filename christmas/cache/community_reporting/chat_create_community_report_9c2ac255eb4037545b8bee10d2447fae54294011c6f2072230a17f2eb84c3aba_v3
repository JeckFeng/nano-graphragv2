It comprises several smaller residential groups—Dabang, Gu Bin, Shuiluodong, Wengwei, Qingcayang, Lugu, Lujiaqiao, and Luodong—which form its socio-geographical structure. The village is located in Xingshan Subdistrict (also referred to as Xingshan Street), Majiang County (alternatively spelled Magang County), and is situated near the Xiunitan Reservoir, indicating its relevance in regional water systems and landscape management. Its repeated association with field survey groups and data collection efforts underscores its importance in empirical studies, likely related to rural development, hydrology, or ecological assessment. The high degree score (23) of Guyang Village reflects its central connectivity within the network of entities.

These subgroups are not merely residential clusters but are operationally significant in research contexts. For instance, the Dabang Group is explicitly noted as a location where survey data was recorded, suggesting structured observation or measurement activities. Similarly, Shuiluodong appears in multiple records as both a physical location and a survey site. The presence of dedicated survey groups (e.g., Dabang Group, Gu Bin Group) implies organized research efforts, possibly conducted by governmental, academic, or environmental agencies. The integration of these subgroups into a coordinated data-gathering framework highlights the village’s function as a living laboratory for rural or environmental studies.

This structure is classified as a type C obstruction, suggesting it is part of a standardized system for categorizing hydraulic structures. The existence of such infrastructure indicates active water flow management, likely aimed at flood control, irrigation, or transportation facilitation across riverine areas within the village. Given the proximity to the Xiunitan Reservoir, these weirs may play a role in broader watershed management strategies. The relationship between Xingshan Street and Concrete Weir 02 further situates this infrastructure within the local administrative framework, implying municipal or regional oversight. These features contribute to the technical and environmental significance of the area.

While less detailed information is available compared to Dabang or Gu Bin Groups, its inclusion in the network confirms its status as part of the village’s organizational structure. The bidirectional relationship between Luodong Group and Guyang Village (recorded in relationship 608) emphasizes integration at the community level. Given the pattern observed with other subgroups, it is likely that Luodong Group may also serve as a site for survey activities or local governance functions, although direct evidence of data collection there is not explicitly provided. Its presence reinforces the multi-cluster nature of rural settlements in the region.

These naming differences may reflect transliteration inconsistencies or evolving administrative records but do not undermine the structural integrity of the community network. The consistent association of survey groups with specific locations suggests standardized data collection protocols, which may be important for longitudinal studies or policy planning. Maintaining data accuracy in light of such variations is essential for reliable geographic and administrative analysis.
