As the central organizing document of this community, the plan links multiple governmental actors and establishes a framework for coordinated action. Its issuance signifies a top-down policy initiative with nationwide application, indicating high-level prioritization of water resource security.

The financial backing from 财政部 is essential for translating national policy into on-the-ground outcomes, particularly in geographically vulnerable areas like Guizhou.
