Its ecological and hydrological features make it a key site for environmental monitoring and potential conservation initiatives. The village is also actively engaged in rural development under China’s rural revitalization strategy, balancing infrastructure improvements with ecological protection. Given its role in both governance and natural resource management, 黄泥村 is central to understanding the dynamics of this community.

These groups are dispersed across mountainous terrain, contributing to the area’s agricultural economy while facing environmental challenges. Notably, 大坡组 has been identified as a landslide-prone zone due to its topography and rainfall patterns, making it a focus for geological hazard monitoring and mitigation efforts. This risk necessitates ongoing surveillance and emergency planning by local authorities. The presence of such vulnerabilities underscores the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into rural development planning. These小组 are not only social units but also geographic risk zones, linking community safety directly to environmental conditions.

Visual documentation, including 图5.2-1, provides empirical evidence of survey locations and conditions. The investigation may be part of a broader watershed management or disaster prevention program, given the known landslide risks in areas like 大坡组.
