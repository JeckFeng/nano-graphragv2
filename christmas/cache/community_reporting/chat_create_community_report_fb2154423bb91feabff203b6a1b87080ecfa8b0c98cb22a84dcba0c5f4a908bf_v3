The river traverses multiple settlements including Huangni, Baisha, and Lanshan Villages, where it supports agricultural irrigation and local infrastructure. Its flow is assessed using control cross-sections such as GDZ46, GDZB4, GDZA4X, and GDZA11, with hydrological calculations performed using Manning's formula to evaluate channel capacity and flood risk. The river's behavior is further influenced by anthropogenic factors, including a 4.53% obstruction area ratio attributed to nearby developments like the Majiang County Gold Egg Tray Processing Factory. These characteristics underscore the river’s critical role in balancing ecological health with human activity in Majiang County.

Mayitang Reservoir, located in Lanshan Village, has a capacity of 107,000 m³ and irrigates 580 acres, while Mianhuachong Reservoir in Huangni Village has a normal storage level corresponding to 471,000 m³ and a designed irrigation area of 1,800 acres. Xiaoba Reservoir, situated in Daping Village, is also part of the Gedangzhai River watershed. The Gudong Town Government is directly responsible for their operation, ensuring water availability for agriculture while adhering to county-level water management standards.
