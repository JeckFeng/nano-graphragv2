Each of these locations is explicitly designated as vulnerable to flooding, necessitating early warning systems and evacuation planning. Lu Valley Group and Gubin Village are specifically noted as requiring preparedness for floods exceeding a 5-year recurrence interval, indicating recurring exposure to significant hydrological events. Shuiluodong Group is similarly under monitoring due to its location in a high-risk zone. These settlements represent the primary civilian populations at risk during flood events, making them central to disaster planning and response efforts.

This department intensifies its activities during the汛期 (flood season), indicating a time-bound but critical window of heightened operational focus. Its role is preventative and technical, focusing on hydrological data analysis and infrastructure resilience under defined probabilistic flood scenarios.

It collaborates directly with the水利灾害防御部门 to ensure coordinated monitoring and emergency action, suggesting an integrated institutional approach to flood risk management. The department's involvement in Gubin Village highlights its targeted deployment in areas assessed as vulnerable to frequent or severe flooding.

These represent flood scenarios with 2% and 1% annual exceedance probabilities, respectively, and are used to evaluate drainage capacity and infrastructure resilience. The 100-year flood event is considered a severe benchmark for extreme conditions, while the 50-year event serves as a more frequent but still significant threat level. The relationship between these two models indicates a tiered risk framework, enabling authorities to scale responses according to event severity. These benchmarks are critical for planning evacuation zones, infrastructure upgrades, and emergency resource allocation.

Furthermore, although rare, 100-year flood events are more likely to occur during the汛期, making this period especially critical for preparedness and response readiness. The season serves as a temporal anchor for both monitoring and emergency planning, aligning institutional actions with natural climatic cycles. This cyclical risk pattern allows for predictive planning but also demands sustained vigilance and resource commitment annually.
