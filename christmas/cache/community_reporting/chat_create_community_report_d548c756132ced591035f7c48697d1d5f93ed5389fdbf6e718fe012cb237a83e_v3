The 纵断面 is a key construct, defined along the 深泓线 and incorporating the 15-digit 行政区号 for geographic identification. These entities are interlinked through standardized hydrological survey practices, supporting systematic river morphology analysis.\",\n    \"rating\": 6.5,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the critical role of these standardized measurements in water resource management, flood control, and environmental monitoring.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"纵断面 as the core technical construct\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 纵断面 (longitudinal section) is a central entity in this community, representing a continuous series of riverbed measurements taken along the 深泓线 (thalweg). It serves as a primary tool for analyzing longitudinal terrain changes in river channels. The use of a standardized 15-digit code—composed of a 行政区号 and a sequential identifier—ensures traceability and administrative clarity. This structural design enables consistent monitoring and comparison of riverbed changes over time, which is essential for hydrological modeling and infrastructure planning.

By aligning the longitudinal section with the 深泓线, surveyors ensure that the data accurately reflects the true longitudinal profile of the riverbed. This alignment is crucial for applications such as sediment transport analysis, flood risk assessment, and navigation planning. The relationship underscores a methodological standard in fluvial geomorphology, where precise alignment enhances data reliability.

This integration ensures that hydrological data can be systematically cataloged and retrieved at regional or national levels. The use of standardized administrative codes supports inter-agency data sharing, regulatory compliance, and long-term environmental monitoring.

Cross-sections are used to measure the width and shape of the riverbed perpendicular to the flow direction, providing essential data for calculating discharge and assessing channel stability. Notably, control points such as control sections are often established using cross-sectional data, which may also require photographic documentation of riverbanks.
