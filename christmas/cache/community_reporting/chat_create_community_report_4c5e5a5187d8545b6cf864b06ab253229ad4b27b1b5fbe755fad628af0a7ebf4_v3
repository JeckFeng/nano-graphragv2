It requires regular清理 (clearing) of silt, domestic waste, and construction debris to maintain unobstructed water flow and prevent flooding. Accumulation of debris in the 河道 directly contributes to 壅水 (water impoundment), which in turn increases the likelihood of 溃坝风险 (dam failure risk), especially during high-flow periods. The 河道 is also the surrounding area for bridge infrastructure, meaning its condition directly impacts the structural safety of the 桥粱. Persistent neglect of河道 maintenance could result in severe downstream consequences, including infrastructure damage and public safety threats.

As a critical infrastructure component, it must undergo routine structural inspections and debris clearance operations to mitigate risks associated with flooding and water buildup. The bridge’s integrity is directly tied to the condition of its components—桥墩 (piers), 乔台 (abutments), and 乔身 (superstructure)—all of which are subject to wear from water flow and environmental exposure. Failure to maintain the 桥粱 could compromise transport networks and increase the risk of collapse during flood events, especially if 河道 blockages lead to elevated water levels and pressure.

Any failure in these components could be triggered or worsened by hydrological stress from 河道 blockages and 壅水. Their combined vulnerability underscores the importance of proactive monitoring and maintenance.

While currently not posing an immediate threat to住户 (residents), 壅水 represents a significant intermediate risk that can escalate into more severe events such as 溃坝风险 (dam failure risk). The blockage of water due to accumulated debris increases water pressure upstream, which can undermine the foundations of the 桥粱 and its 桥墩. If left unaddressed, prolonged 壅水 could saturate embankments, weaken structural supports, and ultimately trigger catastrophic failures. This condition highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and timely intervention in water management.

Although currently not an active threat to households, the risk is persistent and must be actively managed through monitoring and maintenance protocols. The 溃坝风险 is directly linked to both 河道 conditions and 壅水 levels, indicating a cascading failure pathway: debris accumulation → water impoundment → structural stress → potential collapse. Given the potential for widespread damage to infrastructure, ecosystems, and human settlements downstream, this risk demands prioritized mitigation strategies.

For example, failure to clear 河道 debris leads to 壅水, which increases hydrostatic pressure on the 桥粱 and its 桥墩, raising the likelihood of structural failure and indirectly contributing to 溃坝风险. Similarly, lack of routine inspection of 桥台 or 桥身 may allow small defects to grow into critical flaws under increased water load. This interdependency means that isolated maintenance efforts are insufficient; a holistic, system-wide approach to infrastructure and environmental management is required to mitigate the cumulative risk. The combined degree centrality of key entities (e.g., 河道 and 桥粱 both with degree 4) reflects their pivotal roles in this network.
