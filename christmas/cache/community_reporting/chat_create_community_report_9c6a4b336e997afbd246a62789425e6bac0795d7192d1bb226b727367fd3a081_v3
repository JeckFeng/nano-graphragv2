Its primary function is to provide input for flood modeling in the upper watershed, particularly in relation to downstream analysis efforts. The high degree centrality (6) indicates its importance within the entity network, and its connection to both the Shuiluo Cave Group and the Gedangzhai River highlights its dual geological and hydrological significance.
