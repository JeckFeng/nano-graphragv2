These forms are used during 外业调查 (fieldwork), which is conducted at the 自然村组 (natural village group) level and includes activities like 现有资料现场复核 (on-site verification of existing data) and 补充调查 (supplementary surveys).

The centrality of this entity is reflected in its high degree of interconnectivity, being directly linked to 11 different entities through classification and usage relationships. Each survey form standardizes data collection, ensuring consistency and comparability across regions and enabling centralized risk analysis and response planning. This structured approach enhances the reliability of hazard assessments and supports evidence-based decision-making in disaster preparedness.

These hazards are systematically documented using dedicated survey forms: the 桥梁工程调查表 for bridges, the 路涵工程调查表 for culverts, and the 塘堰坝工程调查表 for ponds and dams. Each of these structures can become a failure point during floods, potentially leading to cascading disasters such as flooding, landslides, or blocked drainage. By classifying these engineering works as risk hazards, the framework emphasizes proactive identification and mitigation. The relationship between these survey forms and the 风险隐患 entity reflects an intentional design to prioritize infrastructure resilience in disaster planning. This targeted approach enhances early warning capabilities and informs engineering interventions to reduce community vulnerability.

Unlike other survey forms that focus on current conditions, this tool provides a temporal dimension to risk assessment, enabling analysts to identify patterns and trends in flood behavior over time. Its integration into the broader survey framework ensures that disaster planning is informed not only by present infrastructure but also by historical evidence of flood impacts.
