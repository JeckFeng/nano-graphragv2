This repeated designation across records confirms his central function in local governance, particularly in emergency monitoring and inter-group communication. The consistency of his contact information, despite minor formatting variations (e.g., 152863 94906), reinforces his established and reliable role within the administrative hierarchy. Liu Yong’s presence in multiple data entries suggests that he is a key figure in ensuring the operational continuity of monitoring systems, especially in relation to flood risk management.
