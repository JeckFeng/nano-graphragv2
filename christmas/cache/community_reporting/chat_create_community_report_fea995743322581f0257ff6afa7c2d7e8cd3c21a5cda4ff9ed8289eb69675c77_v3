The software is especially valuable for extracting gully cross-sections and other detailed topographic features, making it essential for engineering and environmental projects requiring high-accuracy spatial data [Data: Entities (26)]. Terrasolid integrates with other tools in the TerraScan ecosystem, enabling seamless processing of large-scale LiDAR datasets from airborne, mobile, or terrestrial sources. Its ability to classify ground, vegetation, and built features ensures reliable outputs for digital elevation models (DEMs), which are used in flood modeling, urban planning, and corridor mapping [Data: Relationships (36)].

This process corrects for sensor drift, vibration, and signal latency, significantly improving the fidelity of spatial data [Data: Entities (25)]. Beyond POS processing, Inertial Explorer also performs computational analysis (解算) of LiDAR point cloud data, ensuring that raw laser data is properly aligned with navigation data before being passed to downstream tools like Terrasolid [Data: Relationships (165)]. Its output serves as a critical input for advanced classification and modeling workflows, making it indispensable in high-precision remote sensing applications [Data: Relationships (34)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integrated workflow between Inertial Explorer and Terrasolid\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Inertial Explorer and Terrasolid function as complementary components in a unified geospatial data processing pipeline. Inertial Explorer first processes raw inertial and GNSS data to produce refined trajectory and orientation information. This corrected POS data is then exported and imported into Terrasolid, where it is used to accurately georeference LiDAR point clouds. This integration ensures that spatial models maintain high positional accuracy, which is critical for engineering-grade applications such as road design and utility corridor mapping [Data: Relationships (34)]. The Chinese-language descriptions confirm this sequential dependency, noting that after solution processing in Inertial Explorer, the resulting data is imported into Terrasolid for point cloud classification and analysis [Data: Relationships (34)].

The UAV's integration of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) enhances navigation stability and positioning accuracy, which directly supports the quality of the POS data processed in Inertial Explorer. The data collected by the FlyMap VIO UAV forms the foundation of the entire processing chain, feeding into both Inertial Explorer for trajectory correction and Terrasolid for terrain modeling and feature extraction [Data: Relationships (147)].
