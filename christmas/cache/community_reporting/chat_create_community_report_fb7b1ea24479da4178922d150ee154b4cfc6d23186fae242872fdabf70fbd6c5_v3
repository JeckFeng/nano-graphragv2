It integrates multiple tributaries, including the Gendang Zhaihe River, and plays a critical role in regional hydrology and flood management. Due to the area's susceptibility to heavy rainfall and seasonal flooding, the river has been the focus of extensive scientific research aimed at improving flood inundation models and early warning systems. These studies are essential for protecting the densely populated and agriculturally active regions along its banks. The river’s classification within the Dongting Lake System underscores its broader ecological and hydrological significance, even beyond its immediate geographic location. Its high degree score (8) reflects its centrality in the network of relationships among water bodies, monitoring sites, and administrative regions.

Situated along both the Wengwei River and the Gendang Zhaihe River, the group is vulnerable to riverine flooding under 1% (100-year) and 2% (50-year) annual chance flood scenarios. Hydrological monitoring cross-sections GDZ28 and GDZb4 have been established along the Gendang Zhaihe River to collect real-time rainfall and water level data, supporting early warning systems designed to protect the population. A bridge has been constructed over the Wengwei River, enhancing local connectivity but also highlighting the river’s integral role in daily life. Despite discrepancies in river nomenclature—Wengwei River vs. Gendang Zhaihe—the spatial and administrative data confirm the group’s exposure to significant flood risk, necessitating ongoing monitoring and disaster preparedness.

The inclusion of the Chong'an River under the Chong’an River 001 Basin confirms its classification within this larger system, even though it is geographically located in Guizhou Province. This administrative and ecological linkage ensures that local hydrological changes can have downstream implications, necessitating coordinated water management strategies. The system’s complexity is reflected in the network of tributaries and monitoring points, which are essential for modeling flood risks and managing water flow during extreme weather events.

GDZ30 is located on the Gendang Zhaihe River at Taotang Group and corresponds directly to the settlement, serving as a designated monitoring point for water levels and rainfall. Similarly, GDZb4 is used to monitor the Wengwei River (a tributary of the Gendang Zhaihe) near Wengwei Group, providing real-time data to support evacuation decisions during flood events. These monitoring points are tied to established rainfall warning indicators, enabling local authorities to issue timely alerts. The presence of these technical installations reflects a structured approach to disaster resilience, particularly in small, vulnerable communities where rapid response can be life-saving. The data collected at these cross-sections also informs broader hydrological models used across the Dongting Lake System.

However, recent hydrological assessments have reevaluated the area and determined that it does not face significant flood inundation risk, leading to its removal from danger zone status. This reclassification is based on improved topographic and hydrological modeling, demonstrating how updated scientific analysis can refine risk management strategies and support safer rural development. The group, formerly known as Qingcaitang Group, remains a site of interest for environmental monitoring and is associated with control section GDZ30, indicating its continued relevance in watershed studies. This case illustrates the dynamic nature of flood risk assessment and the importance of revising classifications as new data becomes available.
