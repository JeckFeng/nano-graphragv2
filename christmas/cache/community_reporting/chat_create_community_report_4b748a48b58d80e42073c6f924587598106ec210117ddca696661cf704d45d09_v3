Despite its small size, the basin is integral to understanding broader watershed dynamics within the Dongting Lake water system, particularly in the context of mountain flood prediction and mitigation. Its complex topography enables detailed data collection on rainfall patterns, surface runoff, soil erosion, and infiltration rates, supporting advanced simulations and risk assessments. The basin is explicitly linked to the Gudangzhai River (Gegdang Zhaihe), where storm intensity analysis is conducted to refine early warning thresholds. This basin functions as a microcosm for testing and validating flood prevention strategies that may be scaled to other regions. Its inclusion in national technical frameworks such as SL 767-2018 highlights its strategic importance in China’s flood risk management agenda.

Additionally, the 'Mountain Flood Disaster Supplementary Investigation and Evaluation Technical Requirements' serves as a trial framework applied specifically in the basin’s risk analysis, ensuring consistency and scientific rigor. The alignment between local projects and national standards demonstrates a vertically integrated approach to disaster management, where provincial activities are both compliant with and contributory to national knowledge systems. The relationship between SL 767-2018 and the supplementary technical requirements indicates a layered technical architecture that supports adaptive learning and policy refinement.

The Ministry’s influence is evident in the design of the flood risk mapping project and the adoption of SL 767-2018, both of which reflect centrally developed strategies for flood risk management. While the Ministry does not conduct field operations directly, its standards shape the scope, methodology, and reporting requirements of local projects. This top-down governance model ensures uniformity in data collection and risk assessment across different provinces. The moderate degree centrality (3) of the Ministry reflects its role as an enabling and regulatory body rather than an operational one.
