It is situated along the Gudangzhai River and hosts a designated hydrological monitoring site labeled GDZ28, indicating its importance in regional water system assessments. Regular measurements at this site contribute to scientific datasets used in rural and environmental studies. In addition to its environmental role, Wengwei Group is a documented site for field surveys, during which observational data and photographic records have been collected. These surveys support research on socio-economic conditions, architecture, and land use, making Wengwei Group a node of empirical interest. Its inclusion in both administrative and scientific frameworks underscores its significance beyond a mere residential cluster. The group’s formal recognition in local records with population and household data further affirms its status within the village hierarchy.

This hierarchical structure is typical of rural Chinese village systems, where larger villages are subdivided into named residential clusters for governance, planning, and data management. Each hamlet maintains a distinct identity while operating under the jurisdiction of the central village administration. The relationships between Guyang Village and its constituent groups are formalized in local records and field documentation, reflecting a well-defined administrative framework. This structure enables efficient demographic tracking, resource allocation, and coordination of development initiatives. The consistent documentation of household and population data across these groups further supports their use in policy planning and research.

These contact details are consistently referenced across records, reinforcing their function as accessible points of communication for local initiatives. Their repeated association with Wengwei Group, rather than other hamlets, indicates a specialized or concentrated responsibility within this particular sub-unit. This may be due to Wengwei Group’s role in field surveys and environmental monitoring, which likely require dedicated local representatives to facilitate access and coordination. The individuals’ involvement in such activities suggests engagement in administrative, research, or developmental projects, possibly with governmental or academic partners. Their roles as contacts imply a degree of trust and responsibility within the community network, positioning them as key intermediaries between external organizations and village residents [Data: Entities (276, 277, 278); Relationships (341, 346, 351)]+more.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Field surveys enhance community data collection and research integration\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Field surveys have been conducted in both Wengwei Group and Gubin Group, involving photographic documentation and observational data recording, which highlights their integration into research and developmental assessment efforts. These surveys are likely part of broader initiatives to study rural socio-economic conditions, environmental dynamics, or infrastructure. The presence of photographic evidence and structured data collection suggests a methodical approach to understanding local realities, possibly supporting academic research, governmental planning, or development programs. Wengwei Group, in particular, is emphasized as a site of such activity, given its environmental monitoring role and repeated mention in field contexts. The involvement of named contacts—Wang Yingqing, Yu Zaitao, and Bao Chengyun—further indicates organized coordination between local personnel and survey teams. This level of engagement enhances the reliability and accessibility of data collected from the community.

The numerical segments in their identifiers (e.g., 185855 and 35510 for Wang Yingqing) are directly tied to their phone numbers, indicating that these digits serve as practical reference points in administrative or survey records. This system enables efficient identification and outreach, particularly in field operations where rapid coordination is necessary. The consistency across records—despite minor variations such as 'Goyang Village' instead of 'Guyang Village'—demonstrates data coherence and reinforces the reliability of these individuals as stable points of contact. The absence of contradictory information further supports their recognized and unambiguous roles within the community network.
