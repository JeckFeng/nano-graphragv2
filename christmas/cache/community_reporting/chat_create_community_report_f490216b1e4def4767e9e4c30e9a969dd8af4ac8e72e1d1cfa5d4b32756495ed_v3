Key components include small watersheds as analytical units,基层行政单位 for local data collection, and advanced geospatial technologies such as network RTK and Guizhou CORS for high-precision measurements. The workflow integrates infrastructure assessments—including bridge culverts, check dams, and channel encroachments—with flood impact modeling, particularly through溃坝洪水计算法 (dam-break flood analysis), to evaluate downstream risks.

This workflow integrates multiple domains including hydrology, geospatial engineering, infrastructure assessment, and disaster modeling. It operates at the scale of small watersheds and coordinates data acquisition, field measurement, and analytical modeling to produce spatial and tabular outputs for risk management. The high degree centrality (11) and multiple interconnections with other entities underscore its pivotal role in integrating technical, administrative, and geographic components.

These administrative units serve as key data sources during the indoor (non-field) investigation phase, enabling the identification of areas requiring supplemental field measurements. Their involvement ensures that local conditions and community-specific vulnerabilities are incorporated into the technical analysis, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the final risk assessment. This collaboration between technical teams and local governance structures is essential for effective disaster preparedness.

Network RTK is used as the primary method in 图根控制测量 (figure root control surveying), enabling precise determination of coordinates and elevations for control points. The Guizhou CORS system provides real-time correction data that supports these measurements, ensuring consistency and reliability across the surveyed area. This technological foundation is essential for generating spatial data products that meet stringent accuracy standards required for flood modeling and infrastructure analysis.

Each control point is documented with 远近景点照片 (close and distant photographs) named systematically for verification, and all data are compiled into a 控制测量成果表 (control measurement results table) containing coordinates, elevations, and metadata. This standardized workflow ensures long-term traceability and data integrity, which are crucial for future monitoring and validation of flood risk models.

This effect must be analyzed in conjunction with disaster-causing water levels to assess its impact on flood severity. Similarly, 沟滩占地 reduces the natural capacity of gullies to convey floodwaters, increasing flow resistance and flood extent. These analyses are integrated into the broader risk assessment to provide a more complete understanding of flood dynamics.
