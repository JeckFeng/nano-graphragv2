This survey was conducted in Majiang County and systematically evaluated risks including landslides, channel narrowing, bridges, and culverts. Its findings directly inform the current understanding of flood-related vulnerabilities in the region. The high degree centrality of this entity (degree 11) underscores its importance in linking disparate hazard types and locations. The survey not only identified new threats but also verified historical ones, establishing a baseline for risk management and mitigation planning.

This landslide was not previously documented, indicating evolving geohazard conditions that may be influenced by environmental or climatic factors. Its location adjacent to a river increases the risk of mobilization during heavy rainfall or flooding events, potentially leading to property damage or loss of life. The discovery highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive risk assessment in vulnerable watersheds.

The reconfirmation of this site suggests that the underlying geological conditions remain conducive to slope failure, necessitating ongoing surveillance and potential mitigation measures. Unlike newly identified landslides, historical sites may have existing documentation or prior mitigation efforts, but their reactivation remains a concern during extreme weather events. This finding reinforces the value of integrating historical data with current field observations to assess long-term risk.

A total of 10 bridges in Gudong Town and 18 in Xingshan Street were evaluated, along with culverts whose counts were recorded in the survey table. These structures are critical components of transportation infrastructure and their failure during flash floods could disrupt emergency response, isolate communities, or trigger secondary hazards such as upstream flooding due to blockages. The inclusion of these elements in the survey reflects a comprehensive approach to infrastructure resilience, particularly in small watersheds prone to rapid water level changes.

This hazard can increase water velocity and flood levels upstream, exacerbating erosion and the risk of overbank flooding. The presence of multiple narrowing points indicates possible natural or anthropogenic causes, such as sediment accumulation or construction near riverbanks. These constrictions may interact with other hazards like landslides or bridge obstructions, creating compound risks during high-flow events. The survey’s documentation of this condition supports targeted engineering interventions to restore flow capacity and reduce flood risk.

The concentration of findings in this area suggests it may be particularly vulnerable to flash flooding and slope instability, possibly due to topography, land use, or hydrological factors. The high combined degree of relationships involving Xingshan Street (25) indicates its central role in the network of observed hazards. This makes it a priority area for risk mitigation, emergency planning, and future monitoring efforts.
