This process integrates multiple advanced technologies—UAV-LiDAR for above-water topography, CORS-based GNSS for precise georeferencing, and direct sounding methods for underwater bathymetry—to produce high-fidelity cross-sectional models essential for hydrological analysis. These profiles are crucial for flood inundation modeling, channel change detection, and infrastructure planning in dynamic fluvial environments. The integration of diverse data sources ensures comprehensive coverage, even in areas where individual technologies have limitations, such as under dense vegetation or deep water. The centrality of this activity is reflected in its high degree (8) and multiple incoming relationships from key data and measurement components [Data: Entities (70); Relationships (69, 71, 234, 235, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"UAV-LiDAR and Feima VIO drone enable high-resolution aerial data collection\",\n            \"explanation\": \"UAV-LiDAR systems, particularly the Feima VIO drone, are instrumental in collecting high-density 3D point cloud data over watershed areas. The Feima VIO, developed by Feima Robotics, is equipped with LiDAR sensors specifically for topographic and hydrographic surveys, allowing for efficient and accurate data acquisition in otherwise difficult-to-access regions [Data: Entities (220)]. This drone was actively used during the survey period from August 26 to September 1, 2025, to perform point cloud data collection across the study area [Data: Entities (228); Relationships (229)]. The data collected by UAV-LiDAR directly contributes to the generation of LASER POINT CLOUD datasets, which are foundational for extracting cross-sectional terrain features. The use of drones enhances operational efficiency, reduces field time, and improves data resolution compared to traditional surveying methods, making it a cornerstone of modern hydro-geomorphological studies [Data: Entities (53, 54); Relationships (67, 229)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"CORS and Network RTK ensure centimeter-level positioning accuracy\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) network provides the foundational infrastructure for high-precision GNSS positioning across Guizhou Province, enabling real-time, centimeter-level accuracy through Network RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) technology. This system eliminates the need for traditional, time-consuming control surveys by delivering continuous correction data that enhances the reliability of field measurements [Data: Entities (30)]. Network RTK is specifically employed in CONTROL MEASUREMENT tasks to establish FIGURE ROOT POINTS—local survey control points critical for accurate mapping within each watershed [Data: Relationships (50, 51)]. GNSS receivers are deployed at these points and synchronized with the CORS network to ensure spatial consistency across all collected data. This integration is vital in environments where LiDAR may be obstructed, such as mountainous or vegetated areas, ensuring uninterrupted geospatial accuracy [Data: Entities (72, 73); Relationships (83, 84)].

These tools ensure accurate bathymetric data collection, especially in active river channels where submerged topography influences flow dynamics and flood behavior.
