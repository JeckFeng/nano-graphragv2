This terrain represents a mature stage of karst landscape development, where clusters of steep-sided peaks are separated by deep, narrow valleys. Its formation is the result of prolonged interaction between climatic factors, tectonic stability, and the solubility of underlying carbonate rocks. The terrain serves as a physical manifestation of long-term geomorphological processes, making it significant for landscape studies and regional geology.

It involves the chemical dissolution of soluble bedrock—primarily limestone—which leads to the creation of characteristic landforms including sinkholes, gorges, caves, and underground river systems. In the Gedangzhai River basin, this process has been particularly effective due to the region's humid climate and abundant precipitation, which accelerates carbonate weathering. The presence of such processes indicates a dynamic hydrogeological environment with implications for groundwater flow, soil stability, and ecological zoning.

This relationship indicates that karst processes are not merely associated with but are actively responsible for shaping the peak-cluster valley topography observed in the basin. The combined degree of 3 underscores the strength and relevance of this linkage within the network. Over time, preferential dissolution along fractures and bedding planes in limestone has led to the isolation of residual peaks and the deepening of valleys, creating the dramatic landscape seen today. This causal insight is critical for understanding landscape evolution in karst-dominated regions.

Such regions often support unique biodiversity and sensitive hydrological systems, warranting conservation attention. Furthermore, understanding these processes aids in land-use planning, especially in regions where infrastructure development may be vulnerable to subsidence or groundwater contamination.
