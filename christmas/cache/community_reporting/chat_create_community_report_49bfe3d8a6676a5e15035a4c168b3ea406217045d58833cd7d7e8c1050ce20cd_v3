The town also hosts other key water bodies, including the Xiaoba Reservoir and Gubin Stream, reinforcing its centrality in local hydrology.

It is situated on the Xiaoba River, a first-level tributary of the Ge Dangzhai River, and operates under the management of the Gudong Town Government, ensuring local administrative control over water distribution and infrastructure maintenance. The reservoir supports a design irrigation area of 420 mu, indicating its intended role in supporting agricultural productivity in the region. However, the actual irrigated area is currently recorded at 260 mu, suggesting underutilization due to potential constraints such as infrastructure limitations, water availability, or land use changes. This gap between planned and actual usage may indicate inefficiencies or unmet development goals in rural water management.

The reservoir has a normal water level of 1091.80 meters and a dead water level of 1086.76 meters, defining the range within which water is stored and released for irrigation purposes. Its total storage capacity is 12.4 million cubic meters, with a normal usable (active) storage capacity of 8.76 million cubic meters and a dead (inactive) storage volume of 0.69 million cubic meters. These metrics reflect the reservoir’s ability to buffer seasonal variations in rainfall and support consistent water delivery. The dam itself has a maximum height of 9.9 meters, a crest width of 6.0 meters, and a length of 38 meters, indicating a relatively small but functional structure suited for localized water regulation. These technical characteristics are essential for assessing the reservoir’s performance, maintenance needs, and resilience to climate variability.

While specific data on the catchment’s size or ecological condition are not provided, its inclusion in the relational data underscores its functional importance. Given that the reservoir is built on the Xiaoba River, which flows into the Ge Dangzhai River system originating in Gudong Town, the entire watershed is interconnected, meaning upstream activities can impact downstream water resources.

The fact that the actual irrigation area (260 mu) is significantly less than the design capacity (420 mu) could indicate challenges in implementation, infrastructure performance, or coordination between local government and farming communities.
