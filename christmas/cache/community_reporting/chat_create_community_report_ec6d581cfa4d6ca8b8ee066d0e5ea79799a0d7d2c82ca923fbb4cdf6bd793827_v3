MOF is responsible for national fiscal planning, budgeting, and fund allocation, which are essential for executing large-scale infrastructure initiatives like river治理 (governance). Its participation ensures that the plan is backed by fiscal authority and budgetary mechanisms, enabling downstream project financing.

Small rivers, though less prominent than major basins, often flow through rural and densely populated lowland areas where inadequate management can lead to catastrophic flooding. The national plan addresses this vulnerability through standardized assessment, engineering upgrades, and monitoring systems. By integrating financial and technical governance, the initiative strengthens China’s adaptive capacity and reduces long-term economic losses from natural hazards.
