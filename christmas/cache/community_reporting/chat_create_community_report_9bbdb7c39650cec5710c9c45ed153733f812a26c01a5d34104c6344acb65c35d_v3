It comprises several named subgroups—Wengwei, Gubin, Shuiluodong, Lu Gugu, Gujin, Qingcailong (formerly Taitang), Dabang, Lujiaqiao, and others—each functioning as smaller residential or administrative units. This organizational pattern reflects a common rural governance model in China, where larger villages are subdivided into zu (groups) for localized management. The village hosts significant infrastructure, including the Xiniu Tan Reservoir and various engineered river structures like bridges and weirs, indicating active development and environmental management efforts. Its designation of multiple flood-prone areas further emphasizes its role in coordinating disaster preparedness and response. The integration of these elements positions Guyang Village as both a social and infrastructural hub in the region.

Lu Gugu, located at the confluence of the Gubin Stream and Ge Dangzhai River, faces flooding approximately every three years, posing a recurring threat to its 47 residents across 10 households. Shuiluodong Group, with only 14 residents in 3 households, experiences even more frequent flooding, with a recurrence interval of about 2 years, due to its proximity to the Gubin Stream. Gujin Group has a 5-year flood recurrence interval, indicating periodic but predictable risk. Taitang Group, now known as Qingcailong, is recognized as a historical flood risk area, suggesting long-standing exposure. These classifications imply that local authorities must maintain monitoring systems, early warning protocols, and mitigation infrastructure to protect lives and property. The clustering of multiple high-risk zones within a single village amplifies the overall community risk profile.

The presence of contact numbers (e.g., 18585535510 for Wang Yingqing) further supports their function as accessible points of contact, possibly for local governance or disaster management. These individuals are positioned at the intersection of social and administrative networks, making them critical to the resilience and operational continuity of the community, especially during flood events. Their central roles enhance the cohesion of the decentralized village structure, enabling unified action despite the geographic and administrative fragmentation of the hamlets.

The Gubin Group is directly linked to Concrete Weir Dam 07, which likely regulates flow along the Gubin Stream for flood control, irrigation, or domestic use. Similarly, the Lu Family Bridge Group is associated with infrastructure such as weirs and bridges, suggesting coordinated development in flood-prone areas. The Wengwei River Bridge 01 provides critical river crossing for the Wengwei Group, enhancing mobility and emergency access. These structures reflect a blend of environmental adaptation and community-led development, where infrastructure is deployed to mitigate the risks posed by the riverine landscape. The presence of such features indicates investment in resilience, though their effectiveness depends on maintenance and alignment with actual flood patterns.

These variations likely stem from transliteration differences, historical name changes, or administrative updates—for instance, Taitang Group being renamed to Qingcailong. Despite these discrepancies, contextual and geographic evidence confirms they refer to the same entities. For example, the consistent association of Shuiluodong Group with the Gubin Stream and its classification as a flood-prone area across records affirms its identity regardless of spelling. Such variations highlight the challenges in data standardization and the importance of cross-referencing multiple sources to maintain accurate situational awareness. This complexity could affect emergency response coordination or resource allocation if not properly reconciled in official records.
