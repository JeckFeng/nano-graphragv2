As a small watershed within the Dongting Lake system, it represents a manageable yet representative unit for testing and implementing localized flood mitigation strategies. Its high degree centrality (7) in the entity network underscores its structural importance as a hub connecting technical, administrative, and research components. The involvement of a national research institute further highlights its significance as a pilot or case study site for broader flood management applications.
