The geographic placement of the settlement in a flood-prone area raises concerns about resident safety, infrastructure resilience, and long-term habitability under changing climate conditions.

The fact that the Gedang River is under study for flood inundation analysis suggests ongoing efforts to assess or model potential disasters, possibly in response to historical flood events or projected climate trends. This risk could affect emergency planning, insurance coverage, and development restrictions in Mangyazhai.

The settlement’s existence within the watershed means that hydrological changes in the river—such as increased flow due to rainfall or upstream activity—can have immediate consequences on local living conditions. This interdependence necessitates integrated environmental and urban planning approaches to reduce exposure and enhance adaptive capacity.
