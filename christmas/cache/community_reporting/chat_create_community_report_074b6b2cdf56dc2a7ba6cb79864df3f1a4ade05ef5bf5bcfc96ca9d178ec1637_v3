INERTIAL EXPLORER processes Position and Orientation System (POS) data from UAV flights, refining inertial and GNSS measurements to generate precise trajectory and orientation solutions. This corrected data is then imported into TERRASOLID to accurately align and georeference raw LiDAR point clouds, a prerequisite for reliable terrain modeling. The integration ensures that downstream analyses—such as ground classification, vegetation filtering, and gully cross-section extraction—are based on spatially accurate inputs, which is essential for engineering-grade outputs [Data: Relationships (34); Entities (25, 26)]. This sequential dependency highlights a professional-grade data processing pipeline where each software addresses a specific phase: INERTIAL EXPLORER for navigation solution refinement and TERRASOLID for feature extraction and terrain analysis. Such integration is standard in advanced LiDAR workflows and reflects a high level of technical sophistication in the project's methodology [Data: Entities (25, 26); Relationships (34, 165)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"FLYING FISH VIO UAV as the primary data acquisition platform\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The FLYING FISH VIO UAV, manufactured by FlyMap (Fimapper), is the principal aerial platform used for both oblique photography and LiDAR data collection within the project. It is specifically equipped with LiDAR sensors to capture high-precision elevation data in challenging terrain such as gullies and densely vegetated areas where photogrammetry may be insufficient [Data: Entities (131, 153); Relationships (146, 147, 164)]. The UAV operates at a relative flight height of 100 meters and covers approximately 2.7 km², enabling detailed 3D mapping of the small watershed. Its dual capability—supporting both optical and LiDAR payloads—makes it a versatile tool for multi-modal data acquisition, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the survey area. This integrated sensor approach enhances data completeness, particularly in topographically complex or obscured environments, and supports the creation of more accurate digital terrain models. The use of a specialized VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry) system further improves navigation stability and data consistency during flight operations [Data: Entities (131, 152, 153); Relationships (146, 147, 164)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Adherence to national technical standard CH/T3026-2023\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The entire project conforms to CH/T3026-2023, a national technical regulation titled 'Technical Specifications for Oblique Photogrammetry of Real 3D Data,' published by the national surveying and mapping authority. This standard governs the methods, accuracy requirements, and deliverables for oblique photogrammetry projects, ensuring consistency, interoperability, and legal compliance in official mapping activities [Data: Entities (130); Relationships (145)]. By aligning with this regulation, the project ensures that its outputs—particularly the 3D models—are suitable for use in governmental, environmental, and infrastructure planning contexts. Compliance also implies rigorous quality control, standardized metadata, and validation procedures, increasing the credibility and reusability of the generated data.

This 3D MODEL RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS transforms raw oblique imagery into a geometrically accurate 3D representation of the small watershed [Data: Entities (147); Relationships (150, 163)]. The output then undergoes 3D MODEL POST-PROCESSING, which includes repairing water surface gaps, filling holes in mountainous or vegetated regions, removing floating artifacts, and conducting quality assurance checks. These refinements are crucial for producing a visually and geometrically realistic model suitable for visualization, simulation, and decision support [Data: Entities (148); Relationships (162, 153)]. The final model is delivered in SGB format—a specialized 3D tile format optimized for efficient storage, transmission, and integration into GIS and web-based visualization platforms.

Given the high volume and value of LiDAR and imagery data collected over three years, this redundancy is essential for safeguarding against hardware failure, human error, or unauthorized access. The independent management of backups adds an additional layer of accountability and operational resilience. This structured approach to data management reflects a mature project governance model, aligning with best practices in data stewardship for long-term scientific and engineering projects.
