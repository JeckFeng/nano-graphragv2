This geographical remoteness is a key factor in their exclusion from flood risk surveys, distinguishing them from other villages in the county that face significant flash flood threats. The village's positioning in higher or less hydrologically exposed terrain reduces its vulnerability to rapid water accumulation during seasonal rains. This isolation provides a natural protective buffer, minimizing the need for intensive flood mitigation infrastructure or emergency planning specific to riverine flooding. However, while direct flood risk is low, indirect risks such as regional displacement or infrastructure strain during county-wide emergencies remain possible.

The rationale for exclusion is consistent for both: their physical distance from the Gendangzhai River means they are not exposed to river flooding, which is the primary hazard mechanism in the region. This status differentiates them from settlements located near the river or downstream from reservoirs like Xiaoba Reservoir, where failure or overtopping could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Their exclusion from monitoring systems and disaster planning focused on flood response may result in fewer allocated resources, but also reflects accurate risk stratification. These groups benefit from being in a lower priority zone for emergency interventions, which allows local authorities to focus on higher-risk areas. Still, comprehensive disaster preparedness should consider secondary risks such as landslides or road isolation during extreme weather.

The presence of the Gendangzhai River and multiple reservoirs, including the Xiaoba Reservoir, contributes to both water resource benefits and environmental hazards. Certain administrative areas within the county, such as Xingshan Street, contain up to seven designated flash flood risk zones, indicating a high concentration of vulnerable communities. These areas face recurrent threats due to heavy seasonal rainfall, narrow valleys, and steep terrain that accelerate runoff. In contrast, Gaoji Village’s low risk status stands in sharp contrast to these high-risk zones, illustrating the spatial heterogeneity of disaster exposure within the same jurisdiction. This disparity underscores the importance of localized risk assessment and targeted mitigation strategies.

This hierarchical relationship is critical for understanding how local governance and disaster management policies are implemented. As a town-level entity, Xianchang Town is responsible for coordinating regional planning, including environmental monitoring and emergency response, even though specific hamlets like those in Gaoji Village may fall outside immediate risk zones. The fact that Gaoji Village is administratively linked to a larger town ensures that it remains within the broader governance framework of Majiang County, despite its physical and hydrological separation from high-risk river systems. This structure enables information flow and potential resource sharing during county-wide emergencies, even if the village itself is not a primary target for flood interventions.

Its flow path defines floodplains and determines which communities are exposed to flash flooding, particularly during periods of intense precipitation. The river basin supports local ecosystems and irrigation systems, but also poses a hazard when water levels rise rapidly. Communities located near the river or downstream from reservoirs are at greatest risk, while those like Piepozhai and Laowachong Groups are deemed safe due to their distance from the river’s influence. This spatial criterion is a primary determinant in current flood risk modeling, emphasizing proximity as a key variable. The river’s role as both a resource and a risk vector highlights the dual nature of water systems in mountainous regions, where human settlements must balance access to water with safety from flooding.
