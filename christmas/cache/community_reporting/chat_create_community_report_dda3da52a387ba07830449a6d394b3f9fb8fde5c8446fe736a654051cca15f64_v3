This integration enables accurate modeling of longitudinal water surface profiles, enhances flood forecasting capabilities, and supports infrastructure resilience planning. By unifying data across multiple monitoring points, GDZALL ensures consistency in hydraulic modeling and improves the reliability of long-term water resource assessments.

The results of these calculations are used to predict flood extents, assess vulnerability of nearby communities, and inform emergency preparedness strategies. The integration of GDZALL into this process enhances the spatial continuity and accuracy of the computed profiles, enabling engineers to simulate river behavior under extreme hydrological conditions.

The repeated use of the same analytical framework across multiple sections supports robust hydraulic modeling, particularly when integrated through GDZALL. This uniformity is critical for developing coherent floodplain maps, designing resilient infrastructure, and establishing regulatory flood zones. The consistency in methodology also facilitates long-term monitoring and trend analysis, enabling detection of changes in river behavior due to climate, land use, or channel modifications [Data: Entities (409, 410, 411, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443)]\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Geographic distribution supports comprehensive river monitoring\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The GDZ-series cross-sections are strategically distributed along the Gedangzhai River, spanning from GDZ2 at 0 meters in Mangya Village to GDZ9 at 1,785 meters downstream.
