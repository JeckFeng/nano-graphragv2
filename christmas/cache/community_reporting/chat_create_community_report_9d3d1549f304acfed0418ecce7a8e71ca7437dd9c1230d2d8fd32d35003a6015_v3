It has a channel width of 8.46 meters and a depth of 1.21 meters, contributing to a relatively small obstruction area ratio of 0.088% and an impounded reservoir capacity of 0.088 million cubic meters. Despite its modest size, the dam's presence on river FE1B1ABA000L suggests it plays a role in local water management, potentially affecting downstream flow, sediment transport, and aquatic ecosystems. The dam's low obstruction ratio indicates it may not pose a major blockage risk under normal conditions, but it could still influence local hydrodynamics during high-flow events.

The bridge spans a channel 4.06 meters wide and 5.08 meters deep, with a cross-sectional morphology labeled as 'A', which may indicate a specific engineered or natural shape affecting flow patterns. Notably, it has a significantly higher impounded reservoir capacity of 7.641 million cubic meters compared to the dam, suggesting that the structure may cause substantial backwater effects during high discharge periods. This implies potential flood risks for upstream areas, especially during heavy rainfall or seasonal flooding. The bridge's structural design and placement on FE1B1ABA000L make it a critical point of infrastructure-river interaction.

The dam is linked to the river as a structure that affects or is constructed on it, while the bridge crosses or connects along it. This shared relationship highlights the river’s functional importance in local infrastructure planning and environmental management. The combined degree of 6 for both relationships (594 and 595) underscores the strength and significance of these linkages. The river likely serves as a conduit for drainage, irrigation, or ecological connectivity, and any obstruction from these structures could have cumulative effects on water flow, sediment deposition, and aquatic habitat fragmentation.

The proximity of these structures (approximately 6.7 kilometers apart based on coordinates) may lead to compounded hydrological impacts. For instance, the backwater effect from 寨河 桥梁 03 could influence the upstream flow conditions near 大坪村混凝土堰坝 01, especially during peak flow events. This clustering increases the importance of integrated flood risk assessment and infrastructure coordination to prevent cascading failures or localized flooding. The spatial co-location also suggests potential planning oversight or deliberate design for regional water control, warranting further investigation into local water resource management policies.

While the dam has a minimal obstruction ratio, the bridge’s significantly higher impounded reservoir capacity indicates a greater potential for flow restriction. During extreme weather events, such as heavy rains or typhoons common in southern China, these structures could contribute to upstream flooding, especially if debris accumulates at the bridge piers or if spillway capacity is insufficient. Additionally, the interruption of natural river flow can affect fish migration, sediment transport, and riparian ecosystems. These cumulative impacts may not be immediately apparent but could degrade long-term ecological resilience and increase maintenance and disaster response costs.
