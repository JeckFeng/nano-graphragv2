It is explicitly used to annotate the locations of residential buildings, enabling alignment between field surveys (外业) and office-based analysis (内业). This integration is essential for ensuring accurate spatial representation of housing distribution, particularly in areas prone to environmental risks. The use of 工作底图 as a unifying reference system enhances data consistency and supports broader planning and emergency response efforts.

This role positions居委会 as critical intermediaries between government planning systems and local populations. Their involvement ensures that socio-administrative data is synchronized with geographic data recorded on the 工作底图.
