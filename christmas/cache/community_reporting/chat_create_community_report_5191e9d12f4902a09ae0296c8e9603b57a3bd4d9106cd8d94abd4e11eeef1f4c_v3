It is situated in a catchment area of 5.98 km² and exhibits a channel slope of 9.94‰, indicating a steep terrain conducive to rapid water flow during precipitation events. This makes GDZA4X essential for accurate hydrological simulations, particularly in flood routing and water surface profile calculations. The control section is referenced in technical analyses to ensure consistency in modeling outcomes and to support engineering designs for hydraulic infrastructure. Its data are foundational for regulatory compliance and watershed planning. Despite initial ambiguity in naming—sometimes associated with the Gulbin Stream and at other times with the Gedangzhai River—the contextual details confirm that GDZA4X lies on a tributary (Gulbin Stream) within the larger Gedangzhai River basin. This alignment reinforces its role as a calibrated point for regional water studies.

The relationship is explicitly defined by the fact that Shuicun (Shuiluodong) is the location where the GDZA4X control point is established, making it a key reference for hydrological surveys and tributary flow studies. This integration of a populated or named location with a technical hydrological node enables both scientific monitoring and local governance coordination in water management. The site's use in flow studies underscores its importance not only for environmental modeling but also potentially for community-level flood preparedness and risk communication. The combined degree of 5 in the relationship highlights the strength of this linkage within the network.

This catchment area contributes runoff to the Gulbin Stream, and its delineation allows for precise modeling of rainfall-runoff processes, time of concentration, and peak discharge estimation. The size and topographic characteristics of this watershed make it suitable for small-scale basin studies that inform broader river system management. Data collected at GDZA4X are used to validate models that simulate how this catchment responds under varying hydrological conditions, such as storm events or seasonal flow changes. These assessments are critical for floodplain mapping and infrastructure resilience planning. The defined watershed boundary also supports regulatory functions, such as environmental impact assessments or land use planning near watercourses.

Such a slope accelerates water conveyance during runoff events, increasing the likelihood of flash flooding downstream if not properly managed. This parameter is a critical input in hydraulic models used to compute water surface profiles and energy gradients along the stream. The steep slope also affects sediment transport, erosion potential, and the design of channel stabilization structures. In flood routing studies, this slope value helps determine the timing and magnitude of flood waves passing through the control section. Consequently, accurate representation of this morphometric feature is vital for early warning systems and emergency response planning in the surrounding areas, including Shuicun.

These profiles are essential for designing bridges, culverts, levees, and other hydraulic structures in the region, ensuring they can withstand projected flood levels. Additionally, such data support compliance with water resource regulations by providing scientifically grounded inputs for environmental assessments and permitting processes. The use of GDZA4X as a calibrated reference point enhances the reliability of regional models, enabling consistent decision-making across different agencies and projects. Its integration into flood routing studies further underscores its utility in predicting downstream impacts during extreme weather events.
