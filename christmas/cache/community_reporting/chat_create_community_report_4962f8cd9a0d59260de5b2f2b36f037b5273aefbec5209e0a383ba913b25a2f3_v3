It is specifically designed to supply drinking water for 60,000 urban residents, indicating its importance as a public utility. With a total storage capacity of 152 million m³ and a mean annual runoff of 8.24 million m³, the reservoir is poised to play a significant role in regional water resource management. Given its scale and purpose, any delays, safety issues, or environmental impacts related to construction could affect a substantial population. The reservoir’s development reflects strategic investment in municipal water security, likely supported by local or regional government planning.

This relationship is critical for governance, regulatory oversight, and coordination of public services related to the reservoir. As the local administrative authority, Xingshan Subdistrict may be responsible for land use permits, community engagement, environmental compliance, and infrastructure integration. The presence of a major water project within its jurisdiction elevates the subdistrict’s role in regional development planning. This administrative linkage also implies that any socio-environmental impacts from the reservoir’s construction or operation will be managed at the subdistrict level.

Ensuring a reliable and safe water supply is fundamental to public health, economic stability, and urban resilience. The reservoir’s design capacity and runoff data suggest it is engineered to meet sustained demand, even under variable hydrological conditions. This underscores its strategic importance in long-term urban planning for Majiang County.
