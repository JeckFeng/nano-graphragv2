These prevention targets are tied to specific geographic and infrastructural features such as bridges, reservoirs, and landslides, indicating a complex, multi-layered risk environment. The subdistrict also hosts key water infrastructure, including the Xiniutan Reservoir under construction, which is intended to supply drinking water to 60,000 urban residents, thereby linking disaster resilience with regional development goals. The administrative role of Xingshan Street integrates environmental monitoring, emergency planning, and community-level risk mitigation, making it a central node in regional water governance.

The town’s vulnerability is further compounded by the presence of multiple geomorphic risk factors, including six instances of channel narrowing and six sharp channel bends, both of which accelerate water flow and increase flood severity during heavy rainfall. Additionally, road culverts, bridges, and three reservoirs in the area were assessed for structural vulnerability, highlighting the intersection of aging or high-risk infrastructure with environmental stress. The survey confirmation of a historical landslide site in Dapu Group, Huangni Village, adds to the cumulative risk profile of the town.

The area has been the focus of advanced geospatial data collection under the L3 Data Foundation project, utilizing oblique photogrammetry to generate high-resolution 3D models and panoramic imagery with precision better than 10cm. This technical foundation enables accurate hazard mapping, cross-sectional analysis, and long-term monitoring of dynamic risks such as landslides and channel changes. The use of standardized spatial referencing through the National 2000 Geodetic and Geographic Coordinate Systems ensures data interoperability and alignment with national frameworks.

The project is situated in a high-risk hydrological zone, necessitating careful engineering to ensure safety during extreme weather events. Its location within a documented flash flood-prone area—home to multiple hazard zones including Lujiqiao and Lugu groups—means the reservoir must be integrated into broader watershed management and emergency response systems. The construction project is directly linked to the administrative oversight of Xingshan Street and is part of a larger effort to balance developmental needs with environmental resilience. Ongoing monitoring and structural design must account for potential geohazards such as landslides and riverbed instability.

In Xingshan Street, a newly identified riverside landslide was discovered near Lujiqiao Group in Guyang Village, posing a direct threat to nearby residents and infrastructure. This finding underscores the dynamic nature of slope instability in the region, possibly exacerbated by rainfall, erosion, or construction activities. In contrast, a historical landslide site was confirmed in Dapu Group, Huangni Village, Gudong Town, indicating long-standing geotechnical vulnerability in that location. These sites are critical for ongoing monitoring and risk communication, as both represent potential failure points during extreme weather. The presence of such hazards necessitates targeted early warning systems, land use restrictions, and potential relocation planning for affected households.

Gudong Town reported 10 bridges, five weirs dams, and three reservoirs, all assessed for structural integrity under flood conditions. Bridges such as Ge Dang Zhai River Bridges 01–03 in Guyang Village have specific obstruction ratios recorded, indicating concerns about debris accumulation and flow restriction during floods. Road culverts, though present, had no quantitative data recorded in the survey table, suggesting a potential data gap. The combination of aging infrastructure, high water flow dynamics, and sediment buildup increases the likelihood of structural failure during flash floods, which could disrupt transportation, exacerbate flooding, or trigger secondary disasters.

Simultaneously, the village hosts critical infrastructure: three river bridges, two concrete weir dams (Guyang Village Concrete Weir Dam 01 and 02), and the under-construction Xiniutan Reservoir. The coexistence of these elements illustrates the delicate balance between development and safety. The weir dams help regulate river flow and mitigate flooding, while the reservoir promises long-term water security.
