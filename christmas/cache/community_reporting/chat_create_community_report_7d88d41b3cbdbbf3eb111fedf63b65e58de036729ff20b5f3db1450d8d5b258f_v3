It establishes protocols for early warning, emergency activation, resource mobilization, and inter-agency collaboration, forming the backbone of China’s crisis management infrastructure. As a high-level strategic document, it enables rapid decision-making during disasters and sets the standard for subordinate emergency plans at regional and sectoral levels.

The policy mandates timely data collection on disaster causes, impacts, response effectiveness, and systemic vulnerabilities, with findings used to inform reconstruction, policy reform, and risk mitigation strategies. By requiring expert-led assessments and promoting transparency through public reporting, the Measures enhance accountability and improve long-term disaster resilience.

They require mandatory safety inspections, risk monitoring, and the development of emergency plans to prevent catastrophic failures, particularly during flood seasons. The regulations also introduce accountability mechanisms, imposing legal consequences for negligence or failure to act. The 2018 revision enhanced the framework with updated technical standards and promoted the use of信息化 (informatization), including digital monitoring systems and safety management platforms, reflecting a shift toward technology-enhanced oversight.
