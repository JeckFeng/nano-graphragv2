These entities are interconnected through hydrological monitoring systems, hazard zone designations, and formal risk assessments. Key infrastructure includes monitoring cross-sections such as GDZA11, GDZB4, and GDZ45, which support real-time flood forecasting and disaster prevention. While some areas like 苔塘组 have been reclassified as low-risk following updated evaluations, others remain under active surveillance due to recurring threats from 5-year flood events and '摆沙' (sediment flows).

It governs multiple high-risk villages including 谷宾村, 翁威组, and 水落洞, and is directly involved in implementing water resource and emergency management strategies. The town is designated as a key area for flood mitigation and geological hazard control due to its complex terrain and the presence of multiple river systems such as the Gubin Stream and Wengwei River. Infrastructure such as flood monitoring cross-sections and hazard zone codes are centrally managed under the town’s authority, indicating a coordinated approach to risk reduction. Its role in housing the administrative framework for disaster response, combined with its physical exposure to recurring hydrological threats, establishes 杏山镇 as the core node in this community. The town's integration of technical monitoring, community-level governance, and adaptive risk reassessment underscores its critical function in regional resilience.

It has been formally identified as a flood hazard area, particularly vulnerable to 5-year recurrence interval floods, and is subject to regular monitoring through the GDZA11 hydrological cross-section. This monitoring station collects real-time data on water levels and discharge, enabling early warning and emergency planning. The drainage basin feeding into GDZA11 covers 11.99 km² with a channel slope of 10.56‰ and Manning’s roughness coefficient of 0.052, indicating significant runoff potential during heavy rainfall. These physical characteristics amplify flood risks, especially during the monsoon season. The presence of such detailed technical monitoring reflects both the severity of the threat and the institutional commitment to managing it. Moreover, the village’s inclusion in broader disaster planning frameworks demonstrates its strategic importance in regional water safety.

It is officially classified as a high-risk flood and geological hazard area, with the hazard zone code GDZ28 assigned to the region. Real-time monitoring is conducted via the GDZB4 cross-section, which tracks water level fluctuations and flood dynamics to support early warning systems. Historical data and watershed assessments confirm that the area is prone to inundation and debris flows, especially during periods of intense precipitation. The local government has established emergency evacuation protocols and risk communication mechanisms to protect residents. The dual designation of both a hazard code and a monitoring section highlights the integrated approach to risk governance in this area.

Initial assessments flagged it as possibly affected by 5-year floods, leading to its inclusion in early warning frameworks. However, subsequent detailed field surveys and modeling revealed that the area does not lie within active flood channels and benefits from effective local drainage and protective infrastructure. As a result, authorities have concluded that 苔塘组 does not face actual flood inundation risk and has been removed from priority monitoring lists. This case exemplifies a data-driven, adaptive governance model in which initial precautionary classifications are refined through scientific validation. The reclassification allows for more efficient allocation of emergency resources while maintaining public confidence in the accuracy of risk assessments.

It is directly impacted by '摆沙' (basha), a term describing both a hazardous sediment transport process and a newly designated flood-prone geographical area. This phenomenon involves recurring movement of sand, silt, and debris that can damage infrastructure, block drainage, and threaten resident safety. The risk at 水落洞 is validated by multiple measurement points indicating active sediment dynamics. '摆沙' is not merely a local condition but a formally classified hazard type in regional risk inventories, indicating systemic environmental instability in the area. The designation of this hazard underscores the need for long-term engineering controls and land use planning to mitigate impacts. Efforts to manage 摆沙 likely include channel stabilization, sediment traps, and community alert systems, particularly during high-flow seasons.

These include GDZA11 in 谷宾村, GDZB4 in 翁威组, and GDZ45 in 老鼠寨, each serving as a technical node for water level and flow measurement. These sections enable the collection of data critical for flood forecasting, reservoir operation, and emergency response planning. For example, GDZA11 is located on the Gubin Stream within an 11.99 km² catchment, providing representative data for the broader watershed. Similarly, GDZ45 in 老鼠寨 is both a hazard zone code and a monitoring transect, indicating a dual administrative-technical function. The use of standardized codes (e.g., GDZxx) reflects a uniform classification system across the region. However, gaps exist—some areas like 老鼠寨 lack publicly available historical risk data, which may hinder predictive accuracy. Nonetheless, the deployment of this monitoring network demonstrates a mature, science-based approach to disaster risk reduction in rural China.

These include GDZ28 for 翁威组, GDZ30 for 苔塘组 (prior to reclassification), GDZ43 for 陆家桥, and GDZ45 for 老鼠寨. This coding system enables centralized tracking, resource allocation, and integration with regional emergency systems. The existence of these designations indicates that each location has undergone official hazard screening and is recognized as a potential risk area, even if mitigation measures have since reduced actual danger. For example, although 苔塘组 is no longer considered at risk, its prior assignment of GDZ30 reflects historical vulnerability assessments. The persistence of such labels in data systems highlights the importance of maintaining accurate, up-to-date records to prevent misallocation of resources. The systematic use of codes across villages suggests a scalable model for disaster risk governance in rural China.
