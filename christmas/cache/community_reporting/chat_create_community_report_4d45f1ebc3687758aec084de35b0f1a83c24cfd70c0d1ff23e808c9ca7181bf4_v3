The规范 defines standardized methods for collecting, processing, analyzing, and reporting data on critical parameters such as water level, flow rate, sediment load, water quality, precipitation, and evaporation. By mandating uniform technical processes, it ensures that hydrological data are accurate, continuous, and comparable across regions and time periods, which is essential for effective water resource management and scientific research. The规范 also emphasizes scientific rigor, operational feasibility, and quality control throughout the survey lifecycle—from planning to final review. Furthermore, it integrates modern technologies such as automated monitoring systems, remote sensing, and GIS to advance the digitalization and intelligence of hydrological practices. As a foundational document for field hydrology, SL/T196-2015 plays a pivotal role in supporting flood forecasting, ecological protection, and engineering design.

This规范 specifies detailed technical requirements, operational procedures, and instrumentation criteria to ensure data consistency and reliability across different measurement environments. It covers both traditional manual methods—such as staff gauge readings and velocity-area flow measurements—and modern automated systems, including self-recording water level gauges and ultrasonic flow meters. Specific protocols are provided for different measurement techniques, including current meter methods, float gauging, and sediment sampling, with strict guidelines on calibration, data recording, and error control. The规范 also mandates comprehensive documentation and periodic data validation to maintain long-term data integrity. Widely adopted by hydrological stations, water authorities, and research institutions, SL 58-2014 serves as a fundamental reference for hydrological monitoring nationwide. Its integration of technological advancements enhances the precision and efficiency of water data acquisition, contributing to improved flood warning systems and water resource planning.

These rivers are often vulnerable to flooding and erosion due to less robust infrastructure, making their management crucial for rural and regional flood resilience. The办法 outlines clear procedures for project initiation, design, bidding, construction supervision, fund management, and post-project evaluation, ensuring transparency, accountability, and engineering quality. By establishing a formal governance framework, it strengthens institutional oversight and reduces the risk of mismanagement or substandard work in local water projects. This regulation reflects a strategic focus on decentralized yet coordinated river management, particularly in ecologically sensitive or disaster-prone areas. Its implementation helps prioritize investments, streamline approvals, and improve inter-agency coordination at provincial and local levels. As such, it plays a vital role in enhancing national flood control capacity and supporting sustainable watershed development.
