It contributes to the larger Dongting Lake watershed, which is integral to the Yangtze River basin's flood regulation and water resource management. The river is fed by several tributaries, including the Gegendai River and Gendang Zhaihe, forming a complex network that necessitates detailed monitoring and modeling. Due to frequent heavy rainfall and seasonal flooding, the Chong'an River is a focal point for scientific studies on flood inundation, rainfall warning systems, and hydrological impact assessments. These efforts are essential for disaster prevention, environmental protection, and safeguarding nearby communities. The river’s inclusion in the Dongting Lake system underscores its broader ecological and administrative significance within China's water management framework.

These activities are conducted in accordance with national policies overseen by the Ministry of Water Resources of China, ensuring alignment with legal frameworks such as the Water Law and Flood Control Law. The province’s mountainous terrain and susceptibility to flash floods make it a high-priority region for integrated water management. Its efforts include the development of flood risk maps, early warning systems, and community-based monitoring, reflecting a coordinated strategy that combines policy, science, and local engagement. This provincial leadership is critical for enhancing resilience in vulnerable rural communities.

The area is a target for the 'Small Watershed Flood Disaster Four Foresights Capability Building' project, aimed at enhancing forecasting, early warning, pre-evacuation, and pre-deployment capabilities. Field activities such as channel cross-section measurement and rainfall monitoring provide critical input for risk hazard investigation and impact analysis. The China Institute of Water Resources and Hydroelectric Research Guiyang is responsible for conducting the technical work in this watershed, applying standards like SL 767-2018 to ensure methodological rigor.

Key rainfall stations such as Lanshan, Baisha, Xiaoba Reservoir, Mayitang Reservoir, and Miaohuachong Reservoir are strategically located within the basin to capture precipitation data essential for modeling runoff and flood risk. These stations feed into early warning systems that support reservoir operations and community safety. Additionally, specific monitoring cross-sections like GDZ30 at Taitang Group and GDZb4 along the Wengwei River are used for real-time hydrological analysis and flood design. The integration of these systems enables accurate simulation of water surface profiles and inundation scenarios under various return periods (e.g., 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%).

In contrast, Taitang Group, previously classified as high-risk, has been re-evaluated and removed from danger zone status due to improved hydrological understanding, demonstrating the dynamic nature of risk classification. Tiankanzhai is projected to experience flooding under multiple frequency scenarios, highlighting persistent exposure. These assessments are part of a broader effort to link governance units with risk zones, ensuring accountability and targeted interventions.
