Its inclusion in hazard assessments indicates that it is under scrutiny for potential safety deficiencies or environmental risks. Given its designation as having 'potential safety hazards,' the reservoir may require monitoring or mitigation measures to prevent incidents such as structural failure or uncontrolled flooding.

This classification reflects broader concerns about aging or poorly maintained water control structures in mountainous regions where rapid runoff can exacerbate flood impacts. By categorizing reservoirs as hazard types, authorities acknowledge their dual role as both water management tools and potential sources of large-scale disasters if not properly maintained or monitored.
