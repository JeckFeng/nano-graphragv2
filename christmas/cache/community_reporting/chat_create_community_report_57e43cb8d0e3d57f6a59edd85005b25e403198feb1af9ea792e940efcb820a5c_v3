It is explicitly linked to control points GD246 and GD232, which are used to monitor water levels and flow rates—key parameters in hydrological modeling. The high degree centrality of GDZ (degree: 8) underscores its structural importance within the network of entities. These relationships indicate that GDZ functions as a backbone for flood-related assessments and environmental monitoring activities in the region.

As a node with a degree of 4, it maintains a significant but secondary role relative to GDZ, primarily serving as a data collection point for water level and discharge measurements. Its direct linkage to GDZ indicates that data from GD246 feeds into broader river system analyses, particularly those involving flood forecasting and infrastructure planning. The use of such standardized section identifiers suggests integration into formal hydrological survey systems, possibly under governmental or environmental agency protocols.

Although not detailed in the entity list beyond its description, its presence in the relationship data indicates a networked system of monitoring points along the river. Multiple control sections enable spatially distributed data collection, improving the accuracy of hydrological models and flood predictions. The inclusion of GD232 alongside GD246 suggests a comprehensive monitoring framework along GDZ, allowing for comparative analysis across different river segments. This enhances the reliability of flood risk assessments used in emergency planning and infrastructure development.

With a degree of 3, this entity is moderately connected but plays a vital functional role by transforming raw hydrological data into actionable insights. The analysis supports disaster preparedness, land-use planning, and infrastructure resilience strategies.

Errors or inconsistencies in these relationships can propagate into flawed flood maps, potentially compromising public safety and emergency response planning.
