Each section provides specific data including starting distance along the river, thalweg elevation, and measured water edge elevation—parameters essential for constructing accurate water surface profiles. GDZ4 is located at 443 m with a thalweg elevation of 998.579 m, GDZ7 at 1357 m with 994.738 m, and GDZ9 at 1785 m with 993.711 m. These elevations indicate a downstream gradient, which is fundamental for modeling flow dynamics. The use of these sections in flood frequency analysis (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) underscores their role in predicting flood behavior under varying return periods.

These frequencies correspond to return periods of 100-year, 50-year, 20-year, 10-year, and 5-year floods, respectively. By modeling water surface elevations at these intervals, analysts can estimate the likelihood and extent of flooding, which is crucial for zoning regulations, emergency preparedness, and insurance assessments. The inclusion of such a range suggests that the study supports both rare catastrophic events and more common flood scenarios. This layered analysis enhances the utility of the water surface line calculation and underscores its importance in long-term water resource management.
