The county's administrative structure includes key towns such as谷硐镇 and杏山街道, which manage local water systems and implement flood control measures. Its role in coordinating water resource use, ecological protection, and hazard mitigation underscores its systemic importance. The presence of multiple monitoring stations and infrastructure projects reflects both the complexity of the regional hydrology and the institutional response to it.

The data collected supports not only local disaster prevention but also broader water resource planning across麻江县. The high degree of connectivity between the river and these monitoring entities (combined degree of 24) highlights the technical emphasis placed on real-time environmental surveillance.

With 11 recorded flood prevention targets,谷硐镇 is a key node in the county’s disaster risk reduction strategy. Its position as the origin of the 格当寨河 further amplifies its hydrological significance.

The design incorporates hydrological data and terrain analysis to ensure structural effectiveness and long-term durability. This infrastructure is essential for protecting both human settlements and agricultural land from flood damage.

These features are particularly dangerous in confined valleys or urbanized sections where floodwaters can rapidly accumulate. Their documentation within the watershed indicates targeted assessment and mapping efforts to identify high-risk zones. These bends may interact with other vulnerabilities such as inadequate drainage or aging infrastructure, compounding flood risks.
