It oversees multiple high-risk zones, including historically vulnerable settlements like Lugu Group and newly identified hazards such as the landslide in Lujiqiao Group. Xingshan Street also hosts key infrastructure—including the Xiugu Tan Reservoir and nine ponds/weirs dams—integral to drinking water supply and flood control. The area is embedded within the Chonganjiang 001 watershed, linking it to broader environmental monitoring and disaster mitigation frameworks. Relationships between Xingshan Street and entities such as RESERVOIRS, PONDS (WEIRS) DAMS, and riverbed land use cases highlight its centrality in managing hydrological risks and balancing development with public safety.\",\n    \"rating\": 7.8,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the presence of multiple flood hazard zones, critical water infrastructure, and vulnerable populations under Xingshan Street’s jurisdiction, posing significant environmental and public safety risks.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Xingshan Street as the central administrative and geographical hub\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xingshan Street serves as the core entity in this community, functioning as a subdistrict-level administrative division responsible for overseeing several villages, including Guyang Village (also referred to as Gutyang Village), Gesa, and associated hamlets. Its governance responsibilities extend to environmental monitoring, flood risk management, and infrastructure development, particularly in the context of the Chonganjiang 001 watershed. The street administers seven flood prevention targets—five established flash flood hazard zones and two newly identified high-risk areas—indicating its active role in regional disaster mitigation planning. Additionally, it hosts the Xiniutan Reservoir construction project, which is vital for urban drinking water supply, underscoring its strategic importance in regional water security. The concentration of both natural hazards and critical infrastructure within its boundaries amplifies its significance in local and county-level decision-making.

These structures contribute to localized water management and flood mitigation efforts, particularly in rural and flood-prone areas. Their presence reflects a decentralized approach to hydrological control, complementing larger reservoir systems. However, the cumulative impact of multiple small dams on downstream flow patterns and flood dynamics requires careful monitoring, especially in a watershed like Chonganjiang 001 where flash flooding is a known hazard. The documentation of these structures indicates an ongoing assessment of all water-related infrastructure for risk and safety.

It was included in field investigations and referenced in Figure 5.2-9 of the source material, indicating its relevance in technical assessments of dam safety and flood risk. As a surveyed water storage facility, it is subject to regulatory oversight and likely integrated into regional water supply and emergency response planning. Its presence contributes to both water security and potential risk, as dam failures or overtopping during extreme rainfall events could threaten downstream communities. The fact that only one reservoir is located in Xingshan Street—compared to three in Gudong Town—highlights a disparity in large-scale infrastructure distribution, yet the single facility remains critical due to its location in a high-risk watershed.

This type of land use involves the encroachment or development on natural floodplains, which can exacerbate flood risks by reducing the river’s capacity to absorb high flows during storm events. Such occupation not only endangers the structures and individuals involved but may also interfere with natural drainage pathways, increasing flood severity for surrounding areas. This finding underscores ongoing challenges in land use planning and environmental regulation within the subdistrict. The identification of this case suggests that enforcement of buffer zones and floodplain management policies may be inconsistent or under pressure from local development needs.

The continued risk to this population highlights potential gaps in relocation programs, early warning systems, or structural flood defenses. Given its status as a known hazard area, Lugu Group likely receives targeted monitoring and preparedness support, but its inclusion in recent assessments suggests the threat remains active.

New hazards like this require rapid integration into risk maps, emergency planning, and monitoring protocols. The fact that it was recently identified suggests either improved surveillance capabilities or the emergence of previously stable slopes into instability, potentially linked to climate variability or infrastructure projects such as reservoir construction.
