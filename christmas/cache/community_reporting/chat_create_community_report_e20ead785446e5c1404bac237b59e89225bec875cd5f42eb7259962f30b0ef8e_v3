The repeated appearance of his name and contact number—15286394906 (also formatted as 152863 94906)—in association with different groups underscores his established and trusted position within the village’s governance structure. This consistent linkage across records indicates that LIU YONG is not only a point of contact but also likely a central node for information flow, decision-making, and operational supervision. His role appears to extend beyond mere record-keeping, suggesting active involvement in the day-to-day management and monitoring of village activities.

These groups represent localized clusters within the broader village structure, likely serving as units for governance, resource distribution, and monitoring. The existence of these distinct but interconnected groups suggests a tiered administrative model, where local-level data and operations are aggregated through designated contacts before being reported to higher authorities. This structure enhances administrative granularity but also creates dependencies on key individuals like LIU YONG for accurate and timely reporting.

This cross-group designation indicates that he is not confined to a single hamlet but rather operates at the village-wide level, overseeing multiple areas simultaneously. Such a centralized contact model may streamline communication but also introduces a single point of failure or control within the administrative system. The fact that he is associated with all three groups reinforces his importance in maintaining the integrity of monitoring and transfer processes throughout the village.

In contrast, each of his connections to the sub-groups—GEDA, WANZHAIZU, and YADANG—has a degree of 5, indicating consistent but less intensive linkages. The high degree for the LIU YONG–BAISHA VILLAGE relationship suggests that he is referenced in a wide range of administrative or monitoring contexts, reinforcing his centrality in the network. This pattern of connectivity illustrates a hub-and-spoke model where LIU YONG functions as the hub connecting various administrative units.

On one hand, having one reliable and consistently listed contact like LIU YONG ensures continuity and reduces confusion in administrative processes. On the other hand, it concentrates authority and information flow in a single individual, which could hinder transparency or create bottlenecks if the individual is unavailable or compromised. This structure may be effective for monitoring and reporting purposes but warrants scrutiny to ensure it does not undermine checks and balances within local governance.
