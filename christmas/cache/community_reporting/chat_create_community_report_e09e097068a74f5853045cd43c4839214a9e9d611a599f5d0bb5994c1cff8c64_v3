It includes fields for result type, format, name, and data volume, ensuring consistency and completeness in data delivery. This role makes it a central administrative tool in geospatial data workflows, particularly in surveying, urban planning, or mapping projects where data interoperability and quality control are essential.

This level of granularity allows project teams to track and verify the exact components of data submissions, supporting quality assurance and technical validation. As a subordinate table, it operationalizes the broader structure defined in 汇交成果表, making it critical for execution-level data management.
