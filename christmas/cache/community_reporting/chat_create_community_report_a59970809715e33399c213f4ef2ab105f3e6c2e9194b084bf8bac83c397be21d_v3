This process is essential for hydrological and flood modeling, enabling accurate simulation of water flow, inundation patterns, and channel evolution. The method integrates UAV-mounted LiDAR for high-resolution topographic mapping of exposed banks and floodplains, while also incorporating underwater bathymetry and geospatial referencing via CORS to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Its high degree (8) and multiple relationships with other entities underscore its pivotal role in coordinating diverse measurement techniques. The comprehensive nature of this practice makes it indispensable for modern water resource management, particularly in flood-prone regions where predictive accuracy can save lives and infrastructure [Data: Entities (70), Relationships (71, 234, 235, 72, 74, 76, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integration of CORS DYNAMIC SATELLITE MEASUREMENT for spatial accuracy\",\n            \"explanation\": \"CORS DYNAMIC SATELLITE MEASUREMENT plays a critical supporting role in ensuring the geospatial integrity of cross-sectional data by providing real-time, high-precision GNSS positioning. This method is specifically used to fill data gaps in laser point clouds where LiDAR fails to capture terrain features, such as under dense vegetation or in shadowed riverbanks. By leveraging the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) network, surveyors can achieve centimeter-level accuracy in positioning, which is essential for aligning aerial LiDAR data with ground-based and underwater measurements. This integration enhances the reliability of 3D terrain models used in hydraulic simulations. The relationship between CORS DYNAMIC SATELLITE MEASUREMENT and CROSS-SECTION MEASUREMENT is vital for overcoming technological limitations and ensuring data continuity across heterogeneous environments [Data: Entities (55), Relationships (71)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"UNDERWATER MEASUREMENT as a key component of bathymetric surveying\",\n            \"explanation\": \"UNDERWATER MEASUREMENT represents the collective effort to capture submerged riverbed topography, forming a critical part of the overall cross-sectional analysis. It bridges the gap between aerial LiDAR, which cannot penetrate water effectively, and the need for complete 3D terrain models that include both above- and below-water features. This component relies on various tools and platforms, including manual instruments like the SOUNDING ROD and SOUNDING HAMMER, as well as vessel-based systems like the SOUNDING BOAT, which are deployed according to water depth and accessibility. The data collected through these methods are integrated with LiDAR and CORS-referenced datasets to produce seamless cross-sectional profiles. Given its degree of 3 and multiple incoming relationships, UNDERWATER MEASUREMENT functions as a convergence point for field-level hydrographic data collection, underscoring its importance in comprehensive river modeling [Data: Entities (71), Relationships (72, 74, 76)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Role of manual and vessel-based sounding tools\",\n            \"explanation\": \"SOUNDING ROD, SOUNDING HAMMER, and SOUNDING BOAT are operational tools used to measure water depth in different river conditions, each tailored to specific environmental constraints. The SOUNDING ROD is deployed in shallow areas where manual probing is feasible, providing direct depth readings at discrete points [Data: Entities (56)]. The SOUNDING HAMMER serves a similar purpose but is designed for more robust riverbed conditions, allowing surveyors to determine the depth of sediment or hard substrates in hydrographic fieldwork [Data: Entities (57)]. In deeper or more dynamic sections of rivers, the SOUNDING BOAT is utilized; it is equipped with advanced depth-measuring instruments such as sonar or echo sounders to conduct systematic bathymetric surveys across larger areas [Data: Entities (58)]. These tools collectively ensure that underwater topography is captured across the full range of river environments, from narrow tributaries to wide, deep channels.

By integrating flood mark data, hydrologists can validate and calibrate flood inundation models, improving the accuracy of future predictions. This relationship underscores the importance of combining real-time surveying with historical observations to enhance long-term water management strategies.
