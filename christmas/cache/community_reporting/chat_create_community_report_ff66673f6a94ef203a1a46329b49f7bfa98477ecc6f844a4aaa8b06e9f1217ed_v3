Its course and hydrological behavior are critical to understanding regional flood dynamics, particularly due to its flow regulation by multiple human-made structures. The river is monitored at control sections GDZ2 through GDZ9, which are used for water surface line calculations and flood frequency analysis—key tools in predicting flood events and assessing risks to adjacent communities. These analyses are essential for disaster prevention and land-use planning in flood-prone areas [Data: Entities (91)].\\n\\nThe river’s path through populated zones increases the exposure of local populations to flooding, especially during heavy rainfall. Settlements located near the active floodplain are particularly vulnerable, while those farther away, such as Laowachong and Piepozhai, face lower risk. The presence of bridges and weir dams along the river—especially in Guyang Village—creates water impoundment effects that can exacerbate flooding by obstructing natural flow. These combined factors elevate the river’s importance in regional water management and disaster preparedness planning. The river’s integration into formal monitoring systems underscores its status as a high-priority watercourse for flood risk assessment [Data: Entities (91); Relationships (97)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Xingshan Street as a high-risk administrative zone\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xingshan Street (杏山街) is a key administrative unit in Majiang County that governs multiple village groups, including Guyang Village, and plays a central role in local governance and infrastructure management. It is directly linked to flood risk due to the presence of seven identified dangerous flood zones—five of which are historical flood-prone areas and two newly recognized. This mix of long-standing and emerging risks indicates that flood threats in the area are persistent and potentially worsening, possibly due to environmental changes, infrastructure development, or increased rainfall intensity. The administrative role of Xingshan Street positions it as a critical actor in disaster response, risk communication, and mitigation planning [Data: Entities (362)].\\n\\nThe street's jurisdiction includes five flash flood risk groups within Guyang Village, further emphasizing its vulnerability. As the governing body responsible for local planning and emergency preparedness, Xingshan Street must coordinate with hydrological agencies and implement structural and non-structural flood control measures. Its administrative framework enables targeted interventions, but the concentration of high-risk zones suggests existing measures may be insufficient or require reinforcement. The presence of multiple water-blocking structures within its boundaries—such as concrete weir dams and bridges—adds complexity to flood management efforts, requiring integrated planning across engineering, environmental, and community safety domains [Data: Entities (362); Relationships (440)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Concrete weir dams as critical flood-mitigating and flood-exacerbating infrastructure\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Five concrete weir dams (CONCRETE WEIR DAM 01 to 05) are located in Guyang Village within Xingshan Street, forming a series of engineered structures designed to regulate water flow on the Gedangzhai River. These weirs serve functional purposes such as irrigation support, water impoundment during dry seasons, and regional water distribution. Their construction reflects a strategic, incremental investment in water management infrastructure tailored to local topography and climate. CONCRETE WEIR DAM 05, in particular, is noted for its significant width and depth, enabling substantial water storage and flow control [Data: Entities (494, 508, 509, 510, 511)].\\n\\nHowever, while these dams provide benefits, they also contribute to flood risk by obstructing natural river flow, especially during periods of high discharge. The cumulative effect of multiple weirs can lead to upstream water accumulation, increasing the likelihood and severity of flooding in nearby settlements. Their placement within a known flood-prone administrative area amplifies their potential negative impact, necessitating careful operation and maintenance during extreme weather events. The fact that all five dams are situated within Xingshan Street’s jurisdiction highlights the need for coordinated oversight to balance water resource management with flood safety. These structures are integral to both rural development and environmental risk in the region [Data: Relationships (721, 722, 723, 724, 725)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"River bridges with significant water-blocking effects\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Four bridges—GE DANG ZHAI RIVER BRIDGE 01 through 04—are located over the Gedangzhai River within Guyang Village, Xingshan Street, and contribute to hydraulic obstruction. These bridges are documented with specific metrics such as width, depth, and water-blocking area ratios, which quantify their impact on river flow. Notably, GE DANG ZHAI RIVER BRIDGE 02 has a high阻水面积比 (water-blocking area ratio) of 43.12%, indicating that nearly half of the river’s cross-sectional area is obstructed at this point. Even BRIDGE 04 contributes a 12.06% blocking ratio, which, while lower, still adds to cumulative flow resistance. Such obstructions can lead to localized water impoundment, increased water levels upstream, and heightened flood risk during heavy rainfall [Data: Entities (512, 513, 514, 515)].\\n\\nThese bridges are part of the broader infrastructure network that alters the natural hydrology of the Gedangzhai River. While essential for transportation and connectivity, their design and placement must be evaluated in the context of flood resilience. The presence of impoundment volume data for some bridges suggests that these effects are formally recognized and measured, likely as part of flood modeling efforts. Their location within an administrative area already identified with multiple flood risk zones underscores the compounded vulnerability of the region. Mitigation strategies may include structural modifications, improved drainage, or emergency flow management protocols during flood events [Data: Relationships (726, 727, 728, 729)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integrated flood risk management through monitoring and control sections\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Gedangzhai River is part of a systematically monitored river system with designated control sections labeled GDZ2 through GDZ9.

Such modeling enables authorities to predict flood levels under various scenarios, assess return periods of flood events, and develop risk-informed land-use and emergency plans. The existence of these control points reflects a formalized approach to flood risk management, indicating institutional awareness and technical capacity in the region [Data: Entities (91)].\\n\\nThese monitoring efforts are particularly important given the river’s passage through populated areas and the presence of multiple flow-altering structures. The data collected at control sections likely informs decisions related to dam operations, bridge maintenance, and evacuation planning in Xingshan Street and surrounding villages. The integration of engineering infrastructure with scientific monitoring represents a dual approach to managing both water resources and disaster risks. However, the persistent identification of high-risk zones suggests that predictive capabilities must be matched with effective on-the-ground mitigation and community engagement to reduce actual vulnerability [Data: Entities (91)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Administrative and geographic linkage between Xingshan Street and Guyang Village\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xingshan Street and Guyang Village share a hierarchical administrative relationship, with Guyang Village falling under the governance of Xingshan Street.

Guyang Village contains five flash flood risk groups, making it a focal point for disaster preparedness within the larger street jurisdiction. The administrative integration allows for coordinated planning, resource allocation, and emergency response, but also means that risks in Guyang Village directly impact the broader governance responsibilities of Xingshan Street [Data: Relationships (440)].\\n\\nAll five concrete weir dams and four river bridges are located within Guyang Village, further concentrating critical infrastructure in a high-risk subunit.
