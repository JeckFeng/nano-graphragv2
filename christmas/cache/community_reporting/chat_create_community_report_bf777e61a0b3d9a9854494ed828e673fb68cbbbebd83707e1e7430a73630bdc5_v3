This process involves updating baseline rainfall thresholds that trigger flood warnings or responses, based on changing hydrological conditions and flood frequency analyses. By incorporating data from both '50年一遇洪水顶托' and '100年一遇洪水顶托' scenarios, the revised critical rainfall values aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of early warning systems. This re-evaluation ensures that flood response strategies are aligned with realistic risk projections, particularly in vulnerable settlements such as '杏山街道陆谷组'.

The 50-year event represents a moderate but plausible flood scenario used for baseline risk assessment, while the 100-year event accounts for more extreme conditions, allowing for higher safety margins in infrastructure and emergency planning. The use of both frequencies demonstrates a tiered approach to flood risk management, ensuring that protective measures are robust under varying levels of stress. These scenarios directly inform the adjustment of rainfall thresholds, making them essential to the scientific validity of the resulting prevention strategies.

Given Guizhou's mountainous terrain and susceptibility to flash floods and landslides, localized assessments like this are crucial for effective disaster preparedness.
