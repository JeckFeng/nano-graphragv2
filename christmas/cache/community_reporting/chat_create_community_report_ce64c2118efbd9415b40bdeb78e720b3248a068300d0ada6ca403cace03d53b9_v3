It functions as a core component for hydrological monitoring and early warning systems, indicating its strategic importance in regional environmental management. The data底板's inclusion of both 0.5-meter resolution imagery and 12.5-meter DEM data enables multi-dimensional analysis of land surface and water flow dynamics. This integration suggests a robust, layered approach to geospatial data utilization, particularly relevant for watershed-scale planning and response.

Its application in geographic and hydrological analysis enhances the precision of environmental assessments, particularly when combined with other data layers such as DEM. The coverage of the Chongan River small watershed indicates targeted use for localized water system studies, potentially supporting flood modeling or erosion control initiatives. The reliance on such high-resolution data reflects an advanced capability in remote sensing applications for civil and environmental planning.

By providing elevation data at a 12.5-meter resolution, it supports the modeling of surface runoff, watershed delineation, and slope stability assessments across the Chongan River basin. This data layer is essential for predicting water flow patterns and identifying potential flood-prone areas, making it integral to disaster prevention and water resource management strategies.
