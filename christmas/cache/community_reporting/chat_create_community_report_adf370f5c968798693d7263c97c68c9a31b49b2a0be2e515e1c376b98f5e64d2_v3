It is directly linked to multiple data collection methods and applications, including measurement via 测深锤 and 测深船, processing in 断面数据整理, and application in bridge and dam assessments. Its high degree centrality (7) reflects its pivotal role in integrating various surveying activities. The cross-sectional data enables engineers to assess channel capacity, sediment deposition, and floodplain interactions, which are essential for hydraulic modeling.

While 横断面 captures transverse profiles, 纵断面 traces the river’s deepest flow path (thalweg) over a 100–200 meter range beyond cross-sections, enabling analysis of riverbed elevation changes along its course. Together, these two datasets provide a three-dimensional understanding of river morphology. Their integration during 断面数据整理 allows for the generation of elevation profiles and change detection over time, critical for environmental monitoring and engineering planning.

This activity transforms raw depth and position measurements into standardized output formats, such as Excel tables, which are used for further analysis and reporting. It is directly connected to both 横断面 and 纵断面, indicating its role as a data aggregation and synthesis function. The prominence of this activity, reflected in its degree of 4, underscores its importance in ensuring data consistency and usability across different applications, including flood risk and infrastructure assessments.

The 测深锤 is a manual, weighted instrument used in areas where automated systems are impractical, such as shallow or obstructed waters, providing point-depth data for cross-sectional profiles. In contrast, 测深船 is a vessel equipped with hydrographic technology for systematic underwater topographic mapping, enabling more comprehensive and efficient data collection over larger areas. Both tools feed directly into the creation of 横断面 datasets, with their use determined by environmental and logistical factors.

Similarly, 坝断面测量 focuses on downstream cross-sections of dams to monitor water flow patterns and sediment accumulation, which are vital for dam operation and failure risk assessment. These specialized applications highlight the operational importance of cross-sectional data in civil and environmental engineering.
