The key document, SL 767-2018, directly governs the use and structure of the 建筑物断面测量调查表 (Building Cross-Section Measurement Survey Form), establishing a hierarchical relationship where the standard defines the procedures for data collection using the form.

This national technical standard outlines requirements for data collection, analysis methodologies, and risk assessment protocols essential for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. Its formal status implies adoption by government or municipal agencies responsible for flood control and emergency planning. By defining best practices, SL 767-2018 ensures consistency and reliability in assessing flood impacts on built environments. The standard’s influence extends to field data forms and operational survey activities, making it a central node in flood risk management workflows [Data: Entities (205)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"建筑物断面测量调查表 as a specialized data collection tool\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 建筑物断面测量调查表 (Building Cross-Section Measurement Survey Form) is a specialized instrument used to record structural dimensions of buildings located in flood-prone zones. This form enables field personnel to systematically capture cross-sectional data critical for assessing potential flood damage, structural vulnerability, and evacuation planning. While the form itself is a procedural artifact, its design and usage are directly informed by higher-level technical standards. It represents the operationalization of policy-level guidelines into practical data-gathering instruments used during on-site surveys. The form's specificity suggests targeted application in engineering assessments or post-disaster evaluations. Its role is instrumental in translating technical criteria into measurable field data [Data: Entities (217)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Regulatory dependency between the standard and the survey form\",\n            \"explanation\": \"A clear hierarchical and functional dependency exists between SL 767-2018 and the 建筑物断面测量调查表, where the former prescribes the methodology used in the latter. According to the relationship data, the national technical standard explicitly specifies how building cross-section surveys should be conducted in flood zones, thereby governing the structure, content, and implementation of the survey form. This indicates that the form is not an independent tool but a compliant component of a broader disaster assessment system mandated by SL 767-2018. Such alignment ensures data uniformity across different regions and survey teams, enhancing comparability and analytical validity.

Accurate building cross-sectional data collected via standardized forms contribute to hydrological modeling, inundation mapping, and infrastructure vulnerability assessments. These inputs are vital for early warning systems, urban planning in high-risk zones, and emergency response coordination. The use of standardized methodologies increases the reliability of risk predictions and supports evidence-based decision-making by local authorities. Inadequate adherence to such standards could compromise public safety and reduce the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

The relationship between the technical standard and the survey form represents a critical link in a larger disaster management ecosystem, even if not fully represented in the current dataset. The low degree centrality of the survey form (degree 1) and the moderate centrality of the standard (degree 2) suggest that SL 767-2018 may connect to additional unlisted forms, protocols, or agencies outside this subset.
