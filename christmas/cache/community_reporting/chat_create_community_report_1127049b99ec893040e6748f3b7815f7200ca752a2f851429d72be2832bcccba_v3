With a degree of 3, it demonstrates multiple connections within the network, primarily through its relationships with Gedangzhai Group and Pingzhai Group. Its central role suggests it may function as a local governance or organizational hub for these subgroups, potentially coordinating social, administrative, or cultural activities. The description identifies Baisha Village as a settlement with internal divisions, which is common in rural or ethnically organized communities. This hierarchical structure implies that any policies, developments, or changes initiated at the village level could directly affect the subordinate groups.

With a degree of 1, it has a single documented relationship—its affiliation with Baisha Village—indicating it functions as a subordinate unit. The use of the term 'Zhai' suggests a possible cultural or linguistic specificity, potentially indicating a settlement pattern common in certain regions of China, particularly among ethnic minority populations. The group likely represents a distinct neighborhood, clan, or kin-based settlement within the larger village structure. Its existence as a named subgroup may reflect historical, familial, or geographic distinctions within Baisha Village.

Its degree of 1 reflects a single direct connection—to Baisha Village—through which it is administratively or socially linked. The parallel naming convention between Gedangzhai and Pingzhai suggests a standardized method of identifying sub-village units, possibly based on lineage, topography, or historical settlement patterns. The presence of multiple 'Zhai' units within one village may indicate a decentralized internal structure where each Zhai maintains some autonomy while remaining under the broader authority of Baisha Village. This structure could influence resource distribution, representation, or decision-making at the village level.

Both Relationships (375 and 376) explicitly describe the subgroups as 'constituent residential groups,' confirming an organizational dependency. This type of structure is typical in rural Chinese administrative systems, where larger villages may encompass smaller hamlets or clan-based settlements. The combined degree of 4 for both relationships underscores the strength and significance of these linkages within the network. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for assessing governance, communication flows, and potential points of influence or intervention within the community.

No claims, media reports, or relationships with external organizations are present in the dataset, suggesting the community is primarily a local, residential entity without known controversial affiliations. The absence of such data implies a low potential for conflict, regulatory concern, or strategic threat. This contributes to the moderate impact rating, as the community appears to function as a standard rural settlement without indications of broader influence or risk.
