It serves as a mandatory reference for field projects, ensuring methodological consistency and technical rigor in assessing flood risks. The Mountain Flood Disaster Supplementary Investigation directly follows the specifications outlined in SL 767-2018, indicating its authoritative role in guiding data collection, analysis procedures, and risk classification. This standard is essential for maintaining nationwide uniformity in hazard assessment, especially in high-risk regions like Guizhou Province. Its integration into active field investigations underscores its operational significance and institutional legitimacy.

It operates under standardized guidelines, particularly SL 767-2018, and employs a structured approach combining field surveys with office-based data analysis. With a degree of 3, it is one of the most connected entities in the network, linking to technical standards, watersheds, and supplementary technical requirements. This central role highlights its function as the operational vehicle through which national standards are implemented locally. The project’s outcomes likely inform disaster preparedness, infrastructure investment, and emergency planning, making it a high-impact activity in regional risk mitigation.

These supplementary requirements are applied in the risk analysis of specific basins, such as the Chong'an River 001 Basin, where additional precision or localized data may be needed beyond the base standard. They function as trial guidelines, suggesting ongoing refinement of national protocols based on field experience and emerging data. Their use in conjunction with SL 767-2018 indicates a layered approach to technical governance—where core standards are augmented with context-specific adjustments. This adaptability improves the accuracy and relevance of flood risk assessments in diverse mountainous environments.

The project is explicitly organized on a watershed basis, meaning data collection, hazard mapping, and risk evaluation are conducted within natural hydrological boundaries rather than administrative ones. This approach ensures that analyses reflect actual water flow patterns, catchment dynamics, and ecological interdependencies, leading to more accurate risk assessments. By aligning with natural systems, the investigation supports integrated water resource management and targeted mitigation strategies. The watershed’s role as a foundational unit underscores the scientific rigor and environmental grounding of the project.

The supplementary technical requirements derived from SL 767-2018 are specifically applied in this basin to conduct detailed risk and hazard analysis. This localized implementation demonstrates how standardized methodologies are operationalized in real-world settings, adapting to unique topographical and climatic conditions. The high combined degree of the relationship (8) between the Chong'an River 001 Basin and the supplementary technical requirements indicates a strong, data-intensive linkage, reflecting extensive use of the guidelines in this area. This suggests the basin may be a pilot or high-priority site for flood risk assessment, potentially due to historical flood events or high population exposure.

These components do not operate in isolation but are interlinked through formal and procedural relationships that ensure consistency, scalability, and scientific validity. The supplementary requirements build upon SL 767-2018, while the investigation project applies both in the field using watersheds as analytical units. This layered, integrated approach strengthens China’s capacity to assess and mitigate flood risks in complex terrains. The structured nature of these relationships suggests a mature, institutionalized process for disaster prevention, which is vital for protecting communities in flood-prone mountainous regions.
