These settlements are linked through shared exposure to flooding, with Binx Creek (Binxī Stream) contributing to the river’s flow.

It connects all key settlements either directly through proximity or via tributaries, and serves as the reference point for water surface profiling and inundation modeling. With a degree of 10, it is the most connected entity in the network, interacting with six other entities through flood-related assessments. The river’s influence on surrounding communities is well-documented, particularly in relation to high-probability flood events.

These settlements are located within the watershed and are subject to inundation under various return periods, indicating a systematic assessment of community-level hydrological threats. The inclusion of multiple populated areas in the analysis suggests a regional concern for flood resilience and disaster preparedness. Each village is explicitly tied to the river through flood modeling, emphasizing their shared environmental risk profile.

These frequencies correspond to common flood return periods (e.g., 10-year to 100-year floods), indicating that the village is at risk from relatively frequent extreme events. This level of detail in flood projection suggests that Tiankanzhai is a critical location in the risk assessment, likely due to its location on the riverbanks and potential for recurrent damage.

As a hydrological contributor, it plays a role in the overall flow regime and potential flood amplification within the main river system. Its connection to the Gudangzhai River means that runoff and flooding in the Binxī Stream catchment can influence downstream conditions in villages like Tiankanzhai and Gudangzhai.

Dapu is described as being within the small watershed study area, suggesting targeted hydrological scrutiny. Similarly, Mangya Village is situated near the river and was evaluated for flood risk, positioning it alongside other vulnerable communities.
