It supports real-time, accurate GNSS measurements by delivering correction data required for advanced surveying techniques such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK). The system eliminates the need for traditional high-order control surveys, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy in geodetic operations. Its continuous operation ensures persistent data availability, making it indispensable for applications in areas with challenging topography—such as mountainous or heavily vegetated regions—where other remote sensing methods like LiDAR may be ineffective. The Chinese designation “连续运行参考站系统” underscores its function as a permanent, integrated network designed for dynamic spatial data collection. As the enabling backbone for downstream technologies like Network RTK, the CORS network represents a strategic component of modern geospatial infrastructure in the region.

It is specifically used to establish control points—known as figure root points—within individual watersheds, facilitating precise local mapping and engineering projects. By relying on differential corrections transmitted via the CORS network, Network RTK achieves centimeter-level positioning accuracy in real time, dramatically reducing the time and labor required for traditional surveying methods. This capability is particularly valuable in environments where rapid and reliable ground control is needed despite physical obstructions. The dependency of Network RTK on the CORS system illustrates a direct technological pipeline from infrastructure to application, positioning Network RTK as a critical operational tool in the geospatial workflow.

In this community, control measurement is directly enabled by Network RTK, which serves as the primary method for conducting these surveys. The process involves setting up and measuring specific points—figure root points—that serve as reference locations for all subsequent mapping and engineering activities. These control points ensure spatial consistency and accuracy across large and complex terrains. The integration of Network RTK into control measurement workflows highlights a shift toward digital, real-time surveying practices that enhance both precision and efficiency. This structured approach supports large-scale infrastructure development, environmental monitoring, and land management initiatives throughout Guizhou.

Once established, figure root points serve as fixed reference locations for all downstream surveying, engineering, and cartographic activities within the area. Their placement ensures that spatial data collected across different times and by different teams remain consistent and aligned. The use of standardized procedures for measuring these points enhances data reliability and interoperability across projects. This makes figure root points a crucial link between the digital infrastructure (CORS and Network RTK) and on-the-ground geospatial applications.

Installed on tripods at figure root points, these devices connect to the Network RTK system to receive real-time differential corrections via the CORS network, enabling centimeter-level accuracy in positioning. The receivers function as the physical interface between the satellite-based correction infrastructure and the terrestrial survey network. Their deployment at established control points ensures that high-precision geodetic data can be captured efficiently without requiring prolonged observation periods. This enhances operational throughput and supports rapid data acquisition across extensive and difficult-to-access regions. The widespread use of GNSS receivers in this workflow reflects a broader trend toward automated, high-accuracy field measurement systems in modern surveying practice.

These electronic devices communicate directly with the GNSS receiver, ensuring that all observational data are accurately timestamped and georeferenced. By integrating with the GNSS and Network RTK systems, handheld devices enhance data integrity and reduce human error during field operations. Their use streamlines the measurement process, allowing surveyors to validate data quality on-site and make immediate adjustments when necessary.
