It functions as the overarching domain that is subdivided into smaller 治理单元 to enable targeted risk management, including flood modeling, hazard investigation, and emergency planning. Its role as the origin point for governance structuring underscores its centrality to the entire flood risk framework. The watershed’s location in a mountainous, precipitation-prone region increases its susceptibility to flash floods and landslides, making it a high-priority area for monitoring and intervention.

These gullies, often located in mountainous terrain, channel rapid runoff during heavy rainfall, threatening downstream settlements including 自然村 and 企事业单位. The entity 沟逍 appears to be a typographical or lexical variant of '沟道' (channel), and is likely synonymous with 山洪沟道 in the context of flood risk, as indicated by their direct relationship. The need for cross-sectional measurements of 沟逍 further emphasizes their importance in hydrological modeling and hazard zoning.
