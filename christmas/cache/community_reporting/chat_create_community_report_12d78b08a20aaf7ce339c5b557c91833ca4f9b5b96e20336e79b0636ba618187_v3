It integrates multiple data streams including terrestrial and underwater surveys, flood痕迹, and riverbank and bed characteristics. Its high degree centrality (18) and numerous direct relationships with other entities indicate its foundational role in this network. The activity serves as the unifying framework under which all other entities operate, making it indispensable for accurate terrain modeling and disaster preparedness [Data: Entities (36); Relationships (122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 188, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integration of terrestrial and underwater data\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 断面测量 process combines both 陆上断面 and 水下断面 data to achieve a complete cross-sectional view of river systems. Terrestrial sections are collected using airborne laser point clouds, providing high-resolution elevation data above water, while underwater sections are acquired via depth gauges and boat-based systems to cover submerged areas where aerial methods are ineffective. This integration ensures no blind spots in the survey, enhancing the accuracy of hydraulic models used in flood prediction. The complementary nature of these two data types underscores the technical robustness of the 断面测量 methodology [Data: Entities (102, 103); Relationships (122, 123)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Use of historical flood evidence in risk analysis\",\n            \"explanation\": \"洪痕 (flood marks) are physical indicators of past flood levels and are systematically recorded during 断面测量 fieldwork. These markers provide empirical evidence of historical flood extents, which are critical for calibrating predictive models and assessing the recurrence intervals of extreme events. By incorporating 洪痕 into the survey process, the methodology strengthens its validation against real-world data, improving the reliability of risk assessments. This practice reflects a scientifically grounded approach to disaster preparedness and long-term water management planning [Data: Entities (104); Relationships (124)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Comprehensive recording of riverbank and riverbed characteristics\",\n            \"explanation\": \"During 断面测量, both 左岸 (left bank) and 右岸 (right bank) are photographically documented and geologically described to capture bank stability and erosion potential. Simultaneously, 河床底质 (riverbed substrate) composition is recorded to inform hydrodynamic models about flow resistance and sediment transport. These qualitative and quantitative observations enhance the granularity of the survey data, allowing for more precise simulations of water movement and flood behavior. The inclusion of such detailed environmental observations demonstrates a holistic approach to river system analysis [Data: Entities (105, 106, 107); Relationships (125, 126, 127)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Specialized application for bridge infrastructure\",\n            \"explanation\": \"桥断面测量 (bridge cross-section surveying) is a specialized form of 断面测量 designed to assess the hydraulic conditions around bridges. It requires measurement of cross-sections both upstream and downstream of the bridge to evaluate potential flow constriction, scour risk, and structural vulnerability during flood events. As a designated subtype of the broader 断面测量 activity, it highlights the adaptability of the methodology to critical infrastructure contexts.
