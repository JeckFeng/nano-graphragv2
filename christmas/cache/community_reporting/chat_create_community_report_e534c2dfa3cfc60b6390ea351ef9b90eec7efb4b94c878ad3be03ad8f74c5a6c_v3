Importantly, Majiang County is actively conducting flood risk assessments using 50-year and 100-year flood backwater models to evaluate potential impacts on settlements and infrastructure. These assessments are essential for designing adaptive flood control measures and ensuring community safety. The county’s systematic use of hydrological data and land impact studies reflects a proactive, science-based governance model tailored to the environmental challenges of southwestern China.

These hydrological models simulate extreme flood events that could cause backwater effects in towns and villages, enabling planners to identify vulnerable areas and design appropriate mitigation strategies. The 100-year flood backwater analysis, in particular, supports the evaluation of critical thresholds for flood control infrastructure, such as levees, drainage systems, and reservoir operations. These assessments are being applied in areas like Xingshan Subdistrict, where the construction of the Xiunitan Reservoir must account for long-term flood risks. By integrating these models into planning, Majiang County enhances its capacity to protect lives, property, and infrastructure against increasingly unpredictable climate events.
