Its position within a 77.56 km² drainage basin allows it to capture integrated runoff from upstream tributaries, making it representative of watershed-scale hydrological behavior. The cross-section is defined by a channel roughness coefficient (n) of 0.052 and a longitudinal gradient (J) of 3.49‰, both of which are essential parameters in hydraulic modeling using methods such as Manning’s equation. These physical characteristics enable accurate computation of flow rates under various flood scenarios. Furthermore, GDZ46 is the reference point for the P=2% design flood, calculated at 387 m³/s, which is used to guide infrastructure design and flood mitigation planning in the region. The integration of technical specifications and real-world flood data at this location makes it a cornerstone for scientific and practical water resource management.

This indicates that the 1996 flood was an extreme event, nearly reaching the upper limit of what local infrastructure may have been engineered to withstand. Physical evidence in the form of flood marks (洪痕) was surveyed at an elevation of 823.59 meters near the GDZ46 cross-section, providing empirical data for hydrologists to validate their models. These high water marks were instrumental in applying Manning’s formula to back-calculate discharge, demonstrating the value of field observations in hydrological science. The proximity of the 1996 flood’s magnitude to the design standard underscores its significance as a benchmark for evaluating flood risk and the adequacy of current engineering practices.

This individual provided descriptive details about the extent of flooding, including water levels in their backyard and the inundation of paddy fields, which helped corroborate and contextualize physical evidence. For the 1996 flood, these observations aligned with surveyed flood marks and modeled flows, reinforcing the accuracy of hydrological assessments. Even in the absence of physical flood marks in 2014, resident testimony confirmed the occurrence of a lesser flood event, highlighting the importance of community-based reporting in areas where instrumental records may be lacking. This synthesis of local experiential knowledge and technical modeling exemplifies a robust, multi-source approach to flood history reconstruction and risk assessment.

Historical floods in 1996 and 2014 impacted agricultural land downstream of GDZ46, particularly paddy fields, which are vital to local livelihoods. The 1996 flood, with its high discharge and 2.85% water surface slope, carried significant energy, increasing the risk of erosion and property damage. Although the 2014 event was less severe and lacked confirmable physical evidence, it still disrupted local conditions, indicating ongoing vulnerability. The repeated exposure of Xiao Zhai village to flood events—even those below the design threshold—highlights the need for targeted mitigation measures such as improved drainage, flood warning systems, and land-use planning to protect both people and agricultural productivity.

The P=2% design flood of 387 m³/s, used for engineering purposes, was found to be closely matched by the empirically derived 376 m³/s peak flow of the 1996 flood. This near-equivalence, established through the analysis of high water marks and hydraulic modeling at GDZ46, provides real-world confirmation of the statistical model’s accuracy. Such validation is critical for ensuring that flood protection infrastructure—such as levees, culverts, and bridges—is designed to withstand actual historical extremes. The convergence of observed and designed flood magnitudes strengthens confidence in current hydrological methods while also highlighting the potential for future events to exceed current standards, especially under changing climate conditions.

This absence of physical indicators means that the 2014 event relies solely on resident reports, such as those from Zhuang Villager, for verification. Without measurable high water marks, it is difficult to apply standardized methods like Manning’s formula to estimate peak discharge or validate model outputs. This gap in documentation reduces the scientific utility of the 2014 event for engineering design, despite its relevance to community experience. It underscores the importance of establishing systematic flood marking and surveying protocols after each event to ensure data continuity and improve long-term flood risk assessment.
