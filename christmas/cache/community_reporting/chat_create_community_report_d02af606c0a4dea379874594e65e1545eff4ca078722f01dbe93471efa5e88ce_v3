Key entities include the provincial government’s 2025 Mountain Flood Prevention Project, technical standards such as SL 767-2018, and field data collection tools like the Evacuation Route Survey and Historical Flood Marks forms. These components are interlinked through formal implementation plans, hydrological research frameworks, and environmental conditions shaped by subtropical monsoon climate, karst topography, and high precipitation.

The province’s administration of the Water and Drought Disaster Defense Dispatch Command System further consolidates its role in data integration and emergency response coordination, housing databases that store results from field surveys and hazard assessments [Data: Entities (207); Relationships (247)].

This watershed, located entirely within Guizhou Province, is representative of the complex karst hydrology typical of southwestern China, where surface and groundwater interactions increase flood forecasting challenges [Data: Entities (368); Relationships (494)]. It is specifically designated for application of national technical standards such as SL 767-2018, which guide survey design, data collection, and risk assessment methodologies [Data: Relationships (279, 245, 282)]. The absence of structures causing backwater effects in this area has led to the exclusion of backwater impact analysis, streamlining the assessment process while focusing on direct rainfall-runoff dynamics [Data: Entities (417); Relationships (560)].

This national standard is supplemented by localized procedural documents such as the 'Mountain Flood Disaster Supplementary Survey and Evaluation Technical Requirements,' which enhances risk and hazard analysis with updated field methods and expanded criteria [Data: Entities (238); Relationships (282)]. These complementary standards ensure consistency in survey forms—from building cross-section measurements to historical flood mark documentation—enabling interoperable datasets across jurisdictions and improving the accuracy of flood simulations and early warning systems [Data: Entities (217, 218); Relationships (245, 247)].

These climatic conditions, combined with an average wind speed of 2.5 m/s and a dominant northerly (N) wind direction, contribute to intense seasonal storm events that drive rapid runoff in the steep, dissected terrain of the Qianzhong Highlands [Data: Entities (149, 150); Relationships (166, 167)]. The region’s geology, part of the transitional slope from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the Xiang-Gui hills, features highly erodible karst formations that enhance subsurface flow variability and increase susceptibility to flash flooding and landslides [Data: Entities (126); Relationships (161)].

These forms enable precise documentation of infrastructure vulnerability, emergency response logistics, and past flood extents, which are then integrated into the provincial Water and Drought Disaster Defense Dispatch Command System for analysis and decision support [Data: Entities (207); Relationships (247)].

As such, Guizhou’s implementation of mountain flood prevention measures has regional implications, influencing flood risks and ecological health far beyond its administrative borders.
