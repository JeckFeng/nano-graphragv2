It functions as a primary measurement point for water level, discharge rate, and flood behavior, making it indispensable for hydrological research and water resource management. The site's strategic position at the confluence allows it to capture integrated flow data from two major tributaries, enhancing its utility in modeling complex river dynamics. Historical records from GDZ46, including the 1996 flood peak flow of 376 m³/s, serve as reference points for validating flood models and determining design flood values. The site is associated with a 2% annual exceedance probability (AEP) design flood of 387 m³/s, which informs engineering standards for flood protection infrastructure. Its long-term data collection supports climate impact studies and watershed management decisions.

This measurement is critical for understanding extreme flood behavior in the Ge'dangzhai River basin and serves as a basis for calibrating hydrological models. The data collected during this event contribute to the determination of design flood levels used in infrastructure planning, such as bridges, levees, and drainage systems. The high discharge value observed underscores the potential for severe flooding in the region, necessitating robust mitigation strategies. The fact that this event was formally measured at GDZ46 highlights the site’s reliability and long-standing operational status in the regional monitoring network.

In addition to instrumental measurements, this village provides qualitative and observational data, such as flood marks and eyewitness accounts from the 1996 and 2014 flood events. These community-based observations complement official hydrological records, enhancing data accuracy and temporal continuity. The integration of local knowledge with scientific monitoring strengthens flood risk assessment and improves community resilience. The proximity of residents to the river increases the societal relevance of monitoring activities and underscores the importance of public engagement in flood preparedness.

This site extends the observational network beyond GDZ46, enabling the analysis of flow propagation, flood attenuation, and sediment transport in the lower reaches of the river system. Data from GDZ Downstream 1 are essential for validating upstream predictions and assessing the cumulative impact of flood events as they move through populated areas. The presence of this station in Sanlian indicates a structured approach to flood monitoring that spans multiple communities, improving regional forecasting accuracy. The relationship between Sanlian and this control section highlights the village’s role in supporting scientific infrastructure and public safety initiatives.

This hybrid approach enhances data quality by cross-verifying instrumental readings with physical flood marks and resident testimony, particularly for historical events predating continuous digital monitoring. For instance, accounts from Small Village residents regarding the 1996 and 2014 floods provide context and validation for modeled discharge levels. Similarly, Sanlian’s hosting of GDZ Downstream 1 suggests a sustained partnership between technical agencies and local communities. This integration not only improves the scientific robustness of flood analysis but also fosters trust and cooperation in disaster preparedness and response.

This value informs the construction standards for flood defenses, bridges, and urban development in flood-prone areas along the Ge'dangzhai River. By providing reliable empirical data, GDZ46 ensures that these design values are based on actual hydrological behavior rather than theoretical estimates. The use of such data reduces the risk of structural failure during extreme events and supports cost-effective, evidence-based planning. The downstream extension of monitoring to GDZ Downstream 1 further ensures that design criteria account for flow dynamics across the entire river segment.
