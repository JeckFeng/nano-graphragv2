This phase involves the acquisition of laser-scanned point cloud data, which provides the raw spatial input necessary for subsequent stages such as cross-sectional analysis. The timing of this task, beginning on August 26, aligns with the project's start date, reinforcing its role as the initial data-gathering stage. The data produced here is a prerequisite for downstream processes, particularly for '断面数据编辑' (Cross-Sectional Data Editing), highlighting its critical position in the overall workflow.

This stage has the highest degree centrality (degree = 4), indicating its pivotal role in the network of relationships. It directly depends on the completion of point cloud processing and feeds into the final data compilation phase. The centrality and timing of this activity suggest it is a bottleneck or key control point in the workflow, where data accuracy and quality are likely determined.
