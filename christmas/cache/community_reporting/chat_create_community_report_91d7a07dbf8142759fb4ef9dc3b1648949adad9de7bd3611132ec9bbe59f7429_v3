These entities are linked through their shared role in an environmental survey, with 跨沟桥粱上01 serving as an upper-stream location and 跨沟桥粱下01 as the corresponding lower-stream observation point.

It serves as a designated site for data collection during field surveys, particularly for assessing upstream conditions of the bridge. The entity is referenced in relationship to both geographic context and paired observations downstream, indicating its function as a fixed reference point in environmental monitoring. Its placement suggests a methodological approach to capturing vertical or longitudinal changes across the bridge system.

This entity provides critical visual and structural data that complements the upper-level observations from 跨沟桥粱上01. Together, they enable a full-profile analysis of the bridge’s interaction with water flow, which may be important for flood risk modeling or infrastructure maintenance planning.

These two points are explicitly defined as upstream and downstream counterparts on the same bridge, jointly contributing to a holistic understanding of the structure’s hydrological impact. This paired methodology enhances data reliability by allowing cross-validation of findings across different vantage points.
