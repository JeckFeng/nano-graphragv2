Each subgroup maintains distinct demographic records and serves as a unit for data collection, planning, and local organization. The presence of multiple named groups within a single village highlights the complexity of rural administrative divisions and the importance of granular data management at the hamlet level. This structure enables targeted implementation of policies and research initiatives across different parts of the village. The repeated documentation of population and household counts across these units indicates an emphasis on accurate demographic tracking, likely for governmental or developmental purposes. The integration of these groups into a unified village framework supports coordinated infrastructure development, environmental monitoring, and field survey operations.

Similarly, Yu Zaitao (139858 42282) and Bao Chengyun (182855 50285) are listed as contacts for Wengwei Group, reinforcing their function as communication hubs between external organizations and local residents [Data: Entities (277, 278); Relationships (346, 351)]. The consistent use of phone numbers across records underscores the reliance on personal telecommunications for coordination, particularly in rural settings where formal institutional channels may be limited. These individuals may also be involved in field survey activities, potentially facilitating data collection, logistical support, or community engagement. Their repeated appearance across different datasets suggests they are trusted and accessible figures, playing a critical intermediary role in linking governmental, research, or developmental initiatives with local populations. This network of personal contacts enhances the operational efficiency of fieldwork and administrative tasks within the village.

Its position along a river makes it particularly relevant for assessing flood risks, land degradation, and infrastructure resilience. The group is also linked to multiple contact individuals—Wang Yingqing, Yu Zaitao, and Bao Chengyun—further emphasizing its operational significance in local research efforts. As one of the more actively documented subgroups, Wengwei Group exemplifies how small rural settlements can serve dual roles: as residential communities and as scientific observation points. The data gathered here likely informs regional environmental policies or engineering projects related to water management. Given its integration into both administrative and research frameworks, Wengwei Group plays a disproportionately important role relative to its size.

The app enables real-time data entry, likely improving consistency and reducing errors compared to paper-based methods [Data: Entities (298); Relationships (381)]. Wang Yingqing is associated with this app, suggesting he may use it to record or update survey data, possibly leveraging the structured format of identifiers (e.g., phone number segments) for data tagging or user authentication [Data: Relationships (359)]. The use of a customized mobile application reflects a modernization trend in rural data collection, where digital tools are deployed to bridge the gap between grassroots observations and centralized analysis. This integration supports cross-sectional measurement teams and ensures that localized findings can be aggregated into larger environmental assessments.

The subdistrict oversees critical structures such as concrete weirs and river bridges in Guyang Village, including Concrete Weir 01, Concrete Weir 02, Gedangzhai River Bridge 01, and Gedangzhai River Bridge 02, all of which are located within its jurisdiction [Data: Relationships (614, 615, 616, 617)]. This administrative role positions Xingshan Street as a key intermediary between county-level authorities and rural communities, ensuring policy implementation and resource allocation. The dual characterization of Xingshan Street as both a township-level division and an administrative subdistrict reflects the flexible nature of local governance in transitional or semi-urbanized regions of China. Its oversight of environmental monitoring and infrastructure projects in Guyang Village demonstrates its operational reach and administrative significance. As the formal governing body, Xingshan Street plays a foundational role in enabling the field surveys, data collection, and development activities observed in the community.

These weirs likely serve to manage water levels, support irrigation, or reduce erosion downstream. The two Gedangzhai River Bridges—Bridge 01 with a 0.00% water-blocking area ratio and Bridge 02 with a 43.12% ratio—indicate varying degrees of hydraulic impact, with the latter potentially posing a greater obstruction to natural flow [Data: Entities (454, 456)]. The presence of such infrastructure underscores the hydrological complexity of the area and the need for engineered solutions to balance transportation needs with environmental sustainability. These structures are likely maintained or monitored by Xingshan Street authorities as part of their administrative duties. Their inclusion in geospatial records with precise coordinates (e.g., 107.515985, 26.474111) further suggests integration into formal planning and risk assessment systems.
