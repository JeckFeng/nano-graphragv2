Despite its limited size, the basin is a critical component of the Dongting Lake water system and is the subject of targeted scientific and administrative efforts aimed at mitigating mountain flood risks. The basin's complex topography and susceptibility to extreme rainfall make it ideal for detailed hydrological studies, including channel cross-section measurements, rainfall analysis, and simplified flood inundation modeling. These assessments are foundational to the broader Guizhou Province 2025 Annual Mountain Flood Disaster Prevention Project. The integration of field surveys with advanced data modeling enables precise flood forecasting and supports the development of early warning systems. The basin’s role in linking local monitoring efforts with provincial and national policy underscores its importance in water security and community resilience.

The province has issued its own implementation plan—the Guizhou Province 2025 Annual Mountain Flood Disaster Prevention Project Construction Implementation Plan—demonstrating localized execution of national mandates. This plan includes small watershed analysis, flood modeling, risk hazard investigation, and the construction of community-based monitoring systems. The province’s efforts are aligned with national legal frameworks such as the Water Law and Flood Control Law, overseen by the Ministry of Water Resources of China. Guizhou’s rugged terrain and frequent mountain floods necessitate a systematic, data-driven approach to flood management, integrating field surveys, 3D terrain modeling, and rainfall warning systems. The province also compiles governance unit inventories to link administrative divisions with monitoring stations and risk zones, enhancing accountability and response coordination. These actions reflect a coordinated, multi-tiered strategy to protect vulnerable rural communities and improve hydrological understanding across the region.

This connection is not merely geographical but also administrative, as Chinese water management frameworks classify watersheds based on drainage patterns and hydrological connectivity rather than proximity alone. The Gudangzhai River flows into the Chongyang River, which feeds into Dongting Lake, while the Gendang Zhaihe is a second-order tributary of the Chong'an River. These linkages ensure that flood modeling and risk assessments in Guizhou have downstream implications for flood regulation in central China. The classification of the Chong'an River 001 Basin within the Dongting Lake watershed highlights the systemic nature of water management in China, where upstream interventions directly impact regional water security. This integration necessitates coordinated monitoring and policy implementation across multiple administrative levels and geographic regions.

Wengwei Group, consisting of five households and 23 residents, is located along the Wengwei River, a tributary of the Gendang Zhaihe River, and has been designated a high-risk flood danger zone based on 1% and 2% annual chance flood scenarios. Monitoring cross-sections GDZ28 and GDZb4 are located nearby to support early warning systems, and rainfall-based evacuation protocols have been established. Similarly, Tiankanzhai is projected to experience flooding under 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% flood frequency scenarios, indicating recurring exposure to inundation. These assessments are part of the risk hazard investigation and impact analysis conducted by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research Guiyang. The small size and isolation of these communities amplify their vulnerability, making timely warnings and evacuation planning essential. Their inclusion in the Small Watershed Governance Unit Inventory ensures that administrative oversight is linked to on-the-ground monitoring and emergency response.

These stations are strategically located within the Gendang Zhaihe and Gudangzhai River basins to capture representative precipitation patterns that influence river flow and runoff behavior. The data collected supports flood risk mapping, reservoir operation, and early warning systems, particularly under extreme weather conditions. For instance, the Mayitang Reservoir Rainfall Station provides real-time input for flood modeling on the Gendang Zhaihe River, while the Miaohuachong Reservoir station contributes to understanding catchment-level hydrodynamics. Despite minor spelling variations in station and reservoir names (e.g., 'Miao Huachong' vs. 'Mianhuachong'), all references pertain to the same geographic locations, confirming data consistency. These stations are integral components of the Small Watershed Flood Disaster 'Four Foresights' Capability Building project, enhancing forecasting, early warning, pre-evacuation, and pre-deployment measures.

This standard informs the Mountain Flood Disaster Supplementary Investigation, which includes data collection on hazard zones, infrastructure, and population exposure. Additionally, a Simplified Flood Inundation and Water Depth Analysis Model has been developed to streamline computational predictions of flood extent and depth using updated survey data. These models are used in conjunction with channel cross-section measurements and governance unit inventories to map risk areas to administrative boundaries and monitoring points. The integration of these tools enables accurate, scalable flood modeling that supports both operational decision-making and long-term planning. The reliance on standardized methodologies ensures consistency across regions and compliance with national water management objectives.

Originally classified as a danger zone due to its location along a tributary of the Ge'dangzhai River, Taitang Group—formerly known as Qingcaitang Group—has been reassessed and found not to face significant flood inundation risk. This change reflects improved understanding of local topography, drainage patterns, and river behavior, enabled by detailed field surveys and updated modeling. The group, consisting of six households and 25 residents, remains a monitoring site under hydrological cross-section GDZ30, ensuring continued observation. This reclassification demonstrates the dynamic nature of flood risk management, where data-driven insights can revise risk categorizations, optimize resource allocation, and reduce unnecessary alarm. It also highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and adaptive management in rural flood resilience planning. The process exemplifies how scientific investigation supports more accurate and equitable risk communication and policy implementation.
