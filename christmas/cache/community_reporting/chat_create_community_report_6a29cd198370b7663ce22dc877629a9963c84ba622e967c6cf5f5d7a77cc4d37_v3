This technique allows for the construction of accurate spatial models by adjusting image measurements across multiple viewpoints, minimizing errors through bundle adjustment algorithms. Its role is critical in the production of both digital elevation models (DEMs) and digital orthophoto maps (DOMs), which are widely used in surveying and geographic information systems. The high degree centrality of 3 indicates that this entity is strongly connected within the network, underscoring its importance in the workflow.

These images, captured with significant overlap, enable stereoscopic viewing and are essential for deriving depth and spatial relationships during aerial triangulation. Without high-quality aerial photography, subsequent steps like point cloud generation and DEM creation cannot proceed accurately.

The data confirms this linkage directly: aerial photography provides the image data that aerial triangulation processes to establish 3D point positions. This dependency forms the backbone of automated mapping workflows, where raw imagery is transformed into georeferenced spatial datasets. Disruptions or limitations in aerial photography—such as poor weather, low resolution, or insufficient overlap—directly compromise the accuracy and reliability of aerial triangulation outputs.

By precisely aligning overlapping images and computing the spatial orientation of each photograph, it enables the extraction of dense 3D point clouds, which are interpolated into continuous elevation surfaces. The relationship between 空中三角测量 and DEM is explicitly documented, with a combined degree of 17, indicating a strong and significant connection within the network.
