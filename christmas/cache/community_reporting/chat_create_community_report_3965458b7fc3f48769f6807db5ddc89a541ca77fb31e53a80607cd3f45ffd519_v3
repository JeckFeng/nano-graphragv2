The village acts as a hub for data collection, with repeated references to field surveys conducted across its constituent groups, indicating its significance in regional studies related to environmental or rural development. The presence of engineered water systems like the Xiunitan Reservoir and multiple weirs further underscores its functional importance in water resource management.

The weir's location in Xingshan Street ties it directly to the administrative geography of Guyang Village. These engineered structures suggest a deliberate integration of civil infrastructure with natural waterways, likely supporting agricultural irrigation, flood control, or ecological conservation.

Entities such as Gubin Group, Dabang Group, Wengwei Group, and Luodong Group are explicitly defined as subgroups or sub-localities within the larger village boundary. This structure is consistent with rural governance models in China, where villages are divided into smaller collectives for administrative efficiency. The uniformity in relationship descriptions—such as 'is a subgroup located within'—reinforces the formal nature of these divisions. This administrative layering facilitates localized data collection and management, enabling targeted interventions or monitoring efforts. The structure also supports scalability in research or development initiatives, allowing findings from one subgroup to be compared across others within the same village framework.

The relationship between Xingshan Street and Concrete Weir 02 confirms that the weir is situated within this subdistrict, linking local infrastructure to broader municipal governance. With a combined degree of 8, Xingshan Street appears as a moderate connector in the network, primarily through its association with engineered structures. This suggests that the subdistrict plays a coordinating role in maintaining or monitoring infrastructure within its boundaries, including water control systems in rural villages like Guyang. The administrative reach of Xingshan Street likely extends to oversight of field surveys, environmental compliance, or rural development projects, positioning it as a key actor in regional planning.
