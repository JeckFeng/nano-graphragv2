In comparison, the 2014 flood was reported as significantly smaller, with no identifiable high water marks, reinforcing the exceptional nature of the 1996 event. These comparative assessments are critical for calibrating flood frequency analyses and improving the accuracy of design flood estimates.

Similarly, GDZA4X covers a 5.98 km² catchment with a 9.94‰ slope, making it essential for modeling runoff dynamics in mountainous terrain.
