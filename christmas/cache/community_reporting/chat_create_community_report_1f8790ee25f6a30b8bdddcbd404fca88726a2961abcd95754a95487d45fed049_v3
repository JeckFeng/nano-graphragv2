The investigation integrates remote sensing (e.g., aerial imagery) with on-site verification to ensure accurate risk profiling. Its high degree of connectivity in the network (degree: 11) reflects its pivotal role in coordinating data collection and risk mitigation planning across multiple domains. This central function enables targeted interventions and informs emergency preparedness strategies.

Within these communities, individual 居落居民户 (households) are subject to detailed documentation, including high-resolution photography (minimum 1024x768 pixels), to support property assessment and evacuation planning.

These areas represent significant economic value and are often located in geographically vulnerable regions—such as mountain valleys or river basins—where tourism or industrial activity intersects with natural hazards. The inclusion of these zones highlights the investigation’s role not only in life safety but also in economic continuity and disaster risk reduction for regional development. Protecting these sites helps prevent cascading impacts such as job loss, supply chain disruptions, and loss of tourism revenue following flood events.

These elements are assessed using aerial imagery combined with field validation, ensuring data accuracy and actionable insights.
