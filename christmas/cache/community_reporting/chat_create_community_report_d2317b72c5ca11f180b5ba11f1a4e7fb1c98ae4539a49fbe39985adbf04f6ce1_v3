The investigation integrates both office-based analysis—using GIS, remote sensing, and topographic data—and field surveys to ensure accurate and actionable risk assessments. It systematically covers key components such as hazardous zones, geological risk points, reservoirs, bridges, evacuation routes, and emergency shelters, providing foundational data for disaster prevention and mitigation planning. This dual-phase approach enhances the precision of risk mapping and supports dynamic, data-driven management of flash flood threats. By identifying vulnerabilities in both natural and built environments, the survey enables local authorities to prioritize interventions and strengthen community resilience. The scope and methodological rigor of this investigation underscore its critical role in regional disaster risk reduction.

Located within the surveyed watershed, the reservoir is subject to on-site evaluation, with photographic evidence collected during fieldwork, confirming its inclusion in the physical verification process. As a water retention structure, its condition and capacity directly influence downstream flood dynamics, making it a critical node in the flood risk network. Its inclusion in the survey reflects the emphasis on assessing both natural and engineered systems that could contribute to or mitigate flash flood impacts. The presence of documented field records enhances the credibility and transparency of the risk assessment process. Given its potential influence on flood propagation and community safety, the status of西牛滩水库 must be closely monitored and integrated into broader emergency planning frameworks.

Beyond data gathering,村委会 are tasked with verifying the location and condition of geological hazard points, evacuation routes, and emergency shelters, ensuring that emergency plans reflect ground realities. They also disseminate early warning information and coordinate evacuation drills, positioning them as essential actors in both preparedness and response phases. Their dual function—as data validators and emergency implementers—highlights the importance of local governance in disaster risk management. The integration of村委会 into technical workflows ensures that top-down policies are grounded in local knowledge and community-specific conditions.

Their routes and locations are verified on-site by调查 teams in coordination with村委会, ensuring navigability, safety, and accessibility under emergency conditions. The调查 systematically documents attributes such as route names, geographic coordinates, and their association with specific危险区, enabling precise integration into emergency planning systems. Similarly,安置点 are evaluated for capacity, structural safety, and proximity to hazards to ensure they provide effective refuge. The validation of this evacuation chain is essential for minimizing casualties during rapid-onset disasters. By anchoring these plans in实地核查, the community enhances its operational readiness and public confidence in emergency protocols.

This localized methodology improves the reliability of risk models by incorporating ground-truthed observations from representative micro-communities. Additionally, organizing work around自然村组 enhances logistical efficiency, enabling better coordination with村委会 and residents.
