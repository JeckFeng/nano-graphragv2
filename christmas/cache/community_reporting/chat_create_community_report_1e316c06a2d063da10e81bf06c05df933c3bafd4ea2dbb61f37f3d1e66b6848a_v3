The county is home to significant water bodies like the格当寨河,棉花冲水库 (Mianhuachong Reservoir),蚂蚁塘水库 (Mayitang Reservoir), and小坝水库 (Xiaoba Reservoir), which are vital for irrigation, flood control, and ecological stability. Additionally,麻江县 is identified as an area with environmental and geological risks, including山洪灾害 (mountain flood hazards) and potential landslide zones, necessitating active monitoring and mitigation efforts. Its role as both a governance unit and a hydrological basin makes it central to regional water resource management and disaster prevention strategies.

This river is critical for regional water supply, agriculture, and flood dynamics. Two dedicated rainfall stations—兰山雨量站 (Lanshan Rainfall Station) and摆沙雨量站 (Baisha Rainfall Station)—are located within its watershed, indicating the importance placed on real-time precipitation monitoring to support hydrological modeling and early warning systems. These stations help assess runoff potential and flood risk, especially during the rainy season when mountainous terrain can amplify flash flood threats. The river is also associated with infrastructure such as bridges and dams, including寨河 桥梁 03 and大坪村混凝土堰坝 01, which influence flow characteristics and flood retention capacity. Furthermore, the presence of沟道急弯 (sharp channel bends) along the river course has been documented as a hazard, increasing flow turbulence and erosion risks, particularly during high discharge events. These features collectively underscore the river’s role as both a resource and a risk factor in the region’s environmental management landscape.

It hosts several key reservoirs, including棉花冲水库,蚂蚁塘水库, and小坝水库, all of which are managed in part by local authorities to support irrigation, flood control, and water supply. These reservoirs are integral to the county’s water resource strategy, particularly given the region’s susceptibility to山洪灾害 (mountain floods). The town is also responsible for implementing flood mitigation measures, such as the construction and reinforcement of防洪堤 (flood embankments), aimed at improving channel conveyance and protecting downstream communities. Historical data indicate the presence of a potential landslide hazard in大坡村 (Dapo Village), highlighting the geologically sensitive nature of the area and the need for continuous monitoring. With 11 designated mountain flood prevention targets,谷硐镇 is a recognized priority zone for disaster risk reduction, receiving focused investment in infrastructure surveys and flood control planning. This combination of responsibilities positions谷硐镇 as a key node in the broader water safety network of麻江县.

This river code appears to represent a specific segment or branch of the hydrological network—possibly part of the格当寨河 system—where multiple infrastructure assets are registered. The大坪村混凝土堰坝 01 (Daping Village Concrete Weir Dam 01),寨河 桥梁 03 (Zhai River Bridge 03), and杏山街道谷羊村格当寨 河桥梁 01 (Xingshan Subdistrict Guyang Village Gedangzhai River Bridge 01) are all explicitly associated with this river code, suggesting a standardized hydrological identification system used for engineering and regulatory tracking. This integration allows for coordinated management of flow obstruction, flood retention, and structural safety across different types of infrastructure. For instance, the阻水库容 (water-blocking storage capacity) values—ranging from 0.088 to 7.641 million cubic meters—indicate varying degrees of influence on flood dynamics, with some structures capable of temporarily storing significant volumes during peak flows. The consistent use of geographic coordinates and technical metrics (e.g., channel width, depth, cross-section type) further supports data-driven decision-making in flood risk modeling and infrastructure planning.

One such hazard is the presence of沟道急弯 (sharp bends in the river channel), which have been recorded at 12 locations within the watershed in麻江县. These bends increase flow velocity, induce bank erosion, and raise the likelihood of localized flooding during heavy rainfall. They are especially problematic in narrow valleys and urbanized reaches where natural flood dissipation is constrained. In response,防洪堤 (flood embankments) are being constructed or reinforced in high-risk areas such as镇陆谷组 (Zhenluguzu), aiming to protect against inundation from 20-year or greater recurrence interval floods. Additionally, historical landslide risks, such as the one identified in大坡村 (Dapo Village Group), add to the complexity of land-use planning and infrastructure resilience. These combined hazards necessitate a multi-layered approach to risk reduction, incorporating structural measures (e.g., dams, embankments), real-time monitoring (e.g., rain gauges), and spatial planning. The coordinated presence of these hazards and responses underscores the region’s vulnerability and the urgency of continued investment in flood control systems.

Both stations are situated within the格当寨河 watershed and contribute to assessing precipitation patterns that directly influence runoff and river stage levels. Their data supports early warning systems for山洪灾害 (mountain floods), which are a known threat in this mountainous region of Guizhou. By tracking rainfall intensity and duration, these stations enable authorities to issue timely alerts to downstream communities such as those in杏山街道 and谷硐镇. The placement of two dedicated gauges within the same basin suggests a strategic effort to capture spatial variability in rainfall, which is common in complex terrain. This redundancy improves the accuracy of hydrological models and enhances the reliability of flood predictions. The integration of these stations into a broader monitoring framework—alongside reservoirs, dams, and bridges—demonstrates a systems-based approach to water security, where data informs infrastructure operation and disaster preparedness.

These structures are designed to withstand flooding with a frequency of once every 20 years or more, indicating a focus on protecting high-value or densely populated areas from increasingly intense rainfall events, possibly linked to climate change. The need for improved flood conveyance is particularly acute in谷硐镇, where existing channels may be insufficient to handle peak discharges from the格当寨河 and its tributaries. The implementation of防洪堤 in targeted zones such as镇陆谷组 reflects a prioritization of risk based on historical flooding patterns and topographical vulnerability. These embankments function not only as physical barriers but also as part of a larger integrated system that includes reservoirs, dams, and monitoring stations to regulate water flow and prevent urban inundation. Their development is supported by field surveys and engineering assessments, ensuring alignment with local hydrological conditions. This systematic investment in flood control infrastructure underscores a proactive stance in adapting to environmental challenges.
