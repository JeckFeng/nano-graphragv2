The system is a focal point for hydrological studies, flood inundation analyses, and disaster prevention efforts, with multiple control sections (e.g., GDZA4X, GDZB4) established for monitoring water levels and flow. Key locations such as Shuiluodong, Lantang, and Gudong Village are embedded in this network, where infrastructure like bridges and monitoring stations support both local connectivity and scientific modeling.

It is part of the Chong’an River system (001) within Guizhou Province and contributes to the broader Dongting Lake water system, though this linkage appears to be administrative or misattributed rather than geographic, since the true Dongting Lake lies in Hunan [Data: Entities (1), Relationships (1, 152)]. The river is divided into branches, with Branch A (Gudangzhai River Branch A) containing Gubin Creek and multiple cross-sections (GDZA1 to GDZA8) used for detailed hydraulic modeling [Data: Entities (449), Relationships (611)]. These monitoring points enable precise floodplain analysis and water surface profiling under various return periods (1%, 2%, 5%, etc.), making the Guangdangzhai River a critical node in regional water safety infrastructure [Data: Relationships (614)].

It originates in Dazhai, Daping Village, and flows through Heinitian and Shuiluodong before its confluence, passing through several village groups in Guyang Village [Data: Relationships (149, 150, 151)]. The stream is formally recognized in hydrological assessments, with cross-sections such as GDZA1 and GDZA8 marking the upstream and downstream extents of analysis [Data: Relationships (612, 613)]. The GDZA4X control section, located at Lantang (Shuiluodong Group), serves as a key monitoring point for water level and discharge, supporting flood risk modeling and early warning systems [Data: Entities (405), Relationships (497, 534)]. Additionally, two bridges—Gubin Stream Bridge 01 and 02—cross the stream, linking local communities and serving as infrastructure elements whose stability may influence flood dynamics [Data: Relationships (693, 694)].

The river is designated as branch 'b' in water surface profile diagrams, indicating its formal inclusion in hydraulic modeling frameworks [Data: Entities (120)]. The GDZB4 control section is situated at Wengwei Group on this river, serving as a critical point for measuring the water level-flow relationship, with a channel slope of 11.06‰ and Manning’s n of 0.05 [Data: Entities (404), Relationships (532)]. These hydrological parameters are essential for simulating flood discharges and assessing sediment transport, particularly in the context of flash flood risks common in Guizhou’s karst terrain [Data: Entities (0)].

These sections are used to compute water surface elevations under various flood return periods (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%), enabling accurate floodplain mapping and risk assessment [Data: Relationships (616–624)]. The pairing of left- and right-bank sections (e.g., GDZA3S and GDZA3X) allows for symmetric hydraulic modeling, improving the precision of flow simulations in branched channels [Data: Relationships (617, 618)]. GDZA4X, located at Lantang on Gubin Stream, is specifically designated as both a monitoring cross-section and a hazard zone, highlighting its dual role in data collection and disaster preparedness [Data: Entities (405)]. These monitoring efforts are part of broader studies, including the Water Level-Flow Relationship Study, which synthesizes data from GD232, GD246, and other control points to model discharge characteristics [Data: Relationships (555, 561)].

Dongting Lake is a major freshwater lake in Hunan Province and part of the Yangtze River basin, not a feature of Guizhou’s hydrology [Data: Entities (90)]. However, the data repeatedly refers to the 'Dongting Lake water system' as encompassing the Chong’an River 001 sub-watershed in Guizhou, including the Guangdangzhai and Gedang Rivers [Data: Entities (1, 122), Relationships (1, 152)]. This appears to be a misattribution or administrative categorization, likely stemming from a broader classification of southern Chinese watersheds under the Dongting Lake system, despite the lack of direct hydrological connection. The Chong’an River system in Guizhou is hydrologically isolated from the true Dongting Lake basin, situated instead within Guizhou’s karst-dominated landscape characterized by rapid runoff and flash flooding [Data: Entities (0)].

Shuiluodong Group, for instance, hosts the GDZA4X monitoring cross-section on Gubin Stream, making it a formal node in the hydrological observation network [Data: Entities (405), Relationships (497)]. Similarly, Wengwei Group is the site of the GDZB4 control section on the Wengwei River, linking community identity with technical infrastructure [Data: Entities (404), Relationships (532)]. These locations lie within flood inundation zones, meaning that residents face direct risks during high-flow events, necessitating robust early warning systems and evacuation planning [Data: Entities (393)]. The presence of bridges over Gubin Stream further illustrates the interdependence between community infrastructure and river dynamics, as these structures must accommodate both transportation needs and floodwater passage [Data: Relationships (693, 694)]. Mangyazhai, another settlement in the Gedang River watershed, is explicitly noted as being subject to flood impacts, reinforcing the vulnerability of rural communities in this region [Data: Relationships (632)].

These studies rely on empirical data from control sections like GD232 and GD246, where water level and discharge are measured and modeled using standardized curves [Data: Relationships (555, 561)]. The Flood Inundation Analysis, in particular, determines the spatial extent of flooding under various frequency scenarios, directly informing land use planning and emergency response [Data: Relationships (559)].
