The drainage system, 防洪抢险队伍, and 应急物资 like 照明设备 are integral components designed to mitigate risks. Relationships highlight the need for infrastructure upgrades, emergency preparedness, and equipment readiness to respond to increasingly frequent extreme flood events. Climate change is amplifying the frequency of historically rare floods, necessitating systemic improvements in urban resilience [Data: Entities (494, 483, 504, 495, 501); Relationships (628, 627, 640, 648)].\",\n    \"rating\": 8.7,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the combination of significant flood risk, critical infrastructure dependency, and the potential for widespread damage and loss if protective measures fail during extreme flood events.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"镇陆谷组作为重点防洪区域的核心地位\",\n            \"explanation\": \"镇陆谷组是本社区中的核心地理与工程实体, 被明确列为洪水影响显著区域之一, 涉及防洪堤、挡土墙等防护设施的新建或加固工作。其高关联度（degree=6） underscores its centrality in the network of flood management efforts.

This shift from rare to recurrent event necessitates a reevaluation of infrastructure standards and emergency protocols. The entity’s link to drainage system upgrades indicates a systemic recognition of current inadequacies [Data: Relationships (627)]. Moreover, the push for sponge city concepts—such as permeable pavements and green roofs—reflects a paradigm shift from gray infrastructure to nature-based solutions in flood mitigation planning [Data: Entities (483)].

The need for system upgrades—including increasing pipeline capacity, constructing stormwater retention basins, and integrating smart monitoring technologies—reflects a recognition that legacy systems are insufficient against contemporary climate-driven extremes [Data: Entities (483)]. These enhancements are not isolated projects but part of a broader strategy to future-proof cities against escalating flood risks. Without such upgrades, even moderate rainfall events may trigger severe urban flooding due to overwhelmed networks.
