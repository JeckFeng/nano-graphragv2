These entities are interconnected through their shared function in acquiring underwater elevation and cross-sectional data, supporting hydrological and flood-related studies. The survey leverages both traditional and advanced technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage across various aquatic environments, from shallow to deep waters.

Conducted from August 27 to September 3, 2025, this survey aims to collect detailed underwater terrain data and identify historical flood marks, which are essential for understanding flood behavior, modeling inundation zones, and supporting disaster preparedness efforts. By integrating physical measurements with environmental observations, the mission provides actionable insights for water management authorities and emergency response planners. Its high degree score of 5 indicates strong connectivity within the network, reflecting its function as a central node linking various measurement instruments and methodologies. The integration of both modern and traditional tools ensures data robustness across diverse hydrological conditions.

It is particularly effective in areas where laser-based systems may fail due to signal occlusion—commonly referred to as 'laser point cloud blind zones.' The pole's direct physical contact with the riverbed or seabed allows for high-precision data acquisition, especially suitable for mapping at a 1:2000 scale, which is standard for medium-detail topographic surveys. Its simple structure and ease of operation make it ideal for field use in low-flow or near-shore settings. Notably, it is explicitly linked to the '水下断面测量及洪痕调查' as one of the methods employed in the mission, underscoring its relevance in real-world applications. This integration supports the completeness of cross-sectional data, especially in complex riverine systems where automated systems may not fully capture the terrain.

Despite the availability of advanced sonar systems, the 测深锤 remains valuable due to its simplicity, low cost, and independence from electronic systems, making it highly reliable in remote or resource-limited environments. It serves as a foundational data source for cross-sectional surveys, particularly in rivers, lakes, and coastal inlets where modern equipment may not be accessible or necessary. The tool is directly associated with '断面测量' (cross-sectional measurement), indicating its role in generating baseline underwater elevation profiles. Its continued use highlights the importance of methodological redundancy in ensuring data accuracy and verification across different measurement platforms.

Designed for stability and precision, these vessels can operate in deep and open waters, including offshore and continental shelf regions, where manual tools like 测深杆 or 测深锤 are impractical. The 测深船 plays a crucial role in acquiring continuous bathymetric profiles, detecting submerged hazards (e.g., wrecks, geological anomalies), and supporting maritime safety and infrastructure development. It is directly linked to '断面测量' as a key enabler of underwater data collection, particularly in larger water bodies. The integration of real-time data processing systems allows for immediate analysis and adjustment during missions, significantly improving operational efficiency. Given its technological sophistication and broad application scope, the 测深船 represents the most advanced component of this measurement ecosystem.

While 测深船 dominates in deep and open waters, 测深杆 and 测深锤 provide essential data in shallow, obstructed, or logistically challenging areas where larger vessels cannot operate effectively. This layered approach ensures that no region is left unmeasured, enhancing the completeness and fidelity of the final topographic models. For instance, 测深杆 is specifically used to fill gaps in laser point cloud data, indicating a hybrid methodology that combines optical, acoustic, and mechanical sensing. Similarly, 测深锤 offers a fail-safe manual alternative that validates electronic readings. The coordinated use of these tools within the '水下断面测量及洪痕调查' mission reflects a well-designed survey strategy that prioritizes accuracy, redundancy, and adaptability across diverse hydrological conditions.
