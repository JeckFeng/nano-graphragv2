These subgroups represent both administrative and residential units within the village, contributing to its socio-geographical complexity. The presence of multiple named subgroups indicates a decentralized internal organization, where each subgroup may have distinct land use, population, or economic functions. The village serves as a key unit for local governance and field research, particularly in rural development and environmental studies. Its repeated association with survey groups underscores its role as a site for empirical data collection, likely related to water management, infrastructure, or ecological monitoring. The integration of these subgroups under a single village entity highlights the administrative coherence of the area despite its fragmented settlement pattern.

It functions as a subdistrict responsible for local governance, public service delivery, and infrastructure management in its jurisdiction, which includes Guyang Village and surrounding areas. As a formal administrative unit, Xingshan Street plays a critical role in implementing county-level policies at the grassroots level, particularly in rural planning and development. The subdistrict oversees essential infrastructure such as river bridges and concrete weirs, indicating its involvement in flood control, transportation, and water resource management. Its dual characterization as both a township-level division and an administrative subdistrict reflects the adaptability of China’s local governance framework, especially in transitional or semi-urbanized regions. This structure enables more focused municipal administration while maintaining alignment with the broader county government.

These structures are critical for managing water flow, enabling transportation across waterways, and supporting irrigation and flood mitigation efforts. The coordinates for these structures are precisely recorded, indicating their importance in geospatial planning and monitoring. Notably, Gedangzhai River Bridge 02 has a water-blocking area ratio of 43.12%, suggesting a significant obstruction to natural water flow, which may have implications for downstream hydrology and flood risk. In contrast, Gedangzhai River Bridge 01 has a 0.00% water-blocking ratio, indicating minimal impact on water passage. The concrete weirs are classified as type C obstructions, which typically refer to permanent, engineered barriers designed to regulate water levels. The presence and classification of these structures reflect deliberate engineering efforts to manage the hydrological environment of the region, likely in response to seasonal flooding or agricultural water needs.

The Dabang Group, Gu Bin Group, Shuiluodong, and Wengwei Group are all recorded as locations where field survey data was collected, indicating structured research efforts across the village. These surveys may be related to environmental monitoring, rural development assessments, or infrastructure impact studies, given the presence of water management structures and the village’s proximity to the Xiunitan Reservoir. The repeated emphasis on data collection across multiple subgroups suggests a systematic approach to understanding the village’s socio-ecological dynamics. The involvement of named groups such as the Dabang Group and Shuiluodong in survey work implies local participation or coordination in research initiatives, possibly under the supervision of Xingshan Street or external research institutions. The integration of survey activities into the village’s operational structure highlights its value as a representative case study for rural China’s development challenges and environmental management practices.

The fact that Wang Yingqing appears across multiple independent groups indicates a potential leadership, administrative, or logistical function, possibly serving as a liaison between local residents, researchers, and the Xingshan Street administration. Such a role would be critical in facilitating data collection, infrastructure reporting, or community engagement efforts. The high combined degree of the relationship (32) between Wang Yingqing and Guyang Village further underscores the significance of this individual in the network structure of the community. While no explicit claims about Wang Yingqing’s official title or affiliation are provided, the pattern of associations implies a key operational role in the village’s research and governance activities.

This reflects the standard three-tier rural administrative structure in China, where villages are governed by township-level units (such as subdistricts or towns), which report to county-level governments. Xingshan Street’s official administrative code (522635001000) confirms its formal status within this hierarchy. Guding Town is also noted as a subdivision of Magang County, indicating that the county contains multiple township-level units, each managing their own set of villages and infrastructure. This hierarchical structure ensures policy coherence from the county level down to individual villages, enabling coordinated planning and resource allocation. It also facilitates accountability and data reporting, as seen in the systematic documentation of infrastructure and survey activities in Guyang Village. The administrative clarity of this structure supports effective governance, particularly in regions with complex geographical and hydrological features requiring coordinated management.
