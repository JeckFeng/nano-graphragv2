The high degree of connectivity (degree: 14) reflects its central role in linking technical, environmental, and infrastructural components. Multiple data products and field activities are explicitly tied to this location, including digital mapping, elevation modeling, and panoramic imaging.

Similarly, DOM PRODUCTION generates high-resolution imagery (DOM001.TIF), with better than 3cm ground resolution covering 22.5 km², offering precise visual context for mapping infrastructure and terrain features. These datasets are essential for delineating flood zones, identifying vulnerable areas, and supporting field validation. The fact that these productions are explicitly linked to Chongan River 001 underscores their role as mission-critical deliverables in the overall risk mitigation strategy.

These measurements involve surveying key cross-sections of stream channels to determine both the FLOOD OCCURRENCE WATER LEVEL—the stage at which flooding begins to affect communities—and the HISTORICAL MAXIMUM FLOOD LEVEL, which serves as a benchmark for validating models and defining hazard zones. By integrating historical and observed data, the project enhances the accuracy of flood predictions and early warning thresholds. This linkage ensures that theoretical models reflect actual flood behavior, thereby increasing the reliability of evacuation plans and risk communications. These efforts are directly tied to Chongan River 001, indicating a localized, evidence-based approach to risk management.

These locations are integrated into FLOOD RISK MAPPING to guide early warning dissemination and evacuation planning, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive timely alerts. Additionally, ROADS AND BRIDGES CROSSING STREAMS are identified as critical transportation infrastructure susceptible to failure or blockage during flash floods, while PONDS AND RESERVOIRS are assessed for potential breach risks that could amplify downstream flooding. Together, these elements represent a holistic view of community vulnerability, combining human settlements with engineered systems. The evaluation of such assets ensures that mitigation strategies are not only technically sound but also socially protective.

These zones are known to contribute to or exacerbate flash flood events by altering water flow, triggering sediment surges, or collapsing into channels. Their inclusion in the assessment process allows for a more comprehensive understanding of secondary flood impacts beyond simple rainfall-runoff dynamics. The fact that these hazards are evaluated in relation to infrastructure like roads, bridges, and small reservoirs highlights a systems-based approach to risk analysis. For instance, a landslide blocking a stream could lead to sudden damming and catastrophic outburst floods downstream. This interconnected risk assessment strengthens the predictive capacity of the early warning system.
