As a tributary, Gubin Creek plays a role in the cumulative flood potential of the downstream system, especially given the seasonal concentration of precipitation in the region. Although less prominent in the network, its connection is critical for accurate modeling of flow patterns and flood forecasting.

Approximately 76.8% of annual precipitation occurs between May and September, creating a pronounced seasonal flow regime that increases flood risk during the wet months. Annual rainfall ranges from 1,350 to 1,397 mm, contributing to rapid water accumulation in upstream catchments and necessitating vigilant flood monitoring. This climatic pattern directly affects runoff response, reservoir operations, and the timing of hydrological assessments, making it a primary driver of water management strategies in the region. The Gedangzhai River’s behavior cannot be understood without accounting for this climatic context.

This assessment is critical for identifying vulnerable zones, informing evacuation planning, and guiding infrastructure development in at-risk communities like Huangni Village and Xing Long Group. The analysis leverages data from control sections such as GD246 and GD232, which provide precise measurements for water surface profiling and flow modeling. Despite the absence of certain risk factors that would necessitate additional studies (e.g., backwater effects), the flood inundation analysis remains a central component of regional disaster preparedness. Its implementation reflects a proactive approach to mitigating flood-related threats in a climate-sensitive watershed.

The obstruction and backwater impact analysis was not conducted because there are no dams or significant obstructions that could cause upstream water pooling. Similarly, the flood routing and overflow impact analysis was deemed redundant as no conditions indicating uncontrolled overbank flow or redirection risks were identified. These decisions reflect a risk-based prioritization in hydrological evaluation, focusing resources on meaningful threats rather than universal application of all possible models. This selective approach enhances efficiency in water management planning while still maintaining safety standards.
