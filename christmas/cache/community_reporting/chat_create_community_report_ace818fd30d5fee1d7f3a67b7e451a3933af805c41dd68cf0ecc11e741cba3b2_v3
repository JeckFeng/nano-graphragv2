The model undergoes rigorous multi-level quality checks to validate vertical and horizontal accuracy, making it suitable for engineering-grade applications including hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, and erosion simulation. Its integration into L2 and L3 data infrastructure underscores its strategic importance in national geospatial frameworks. The DEM is projected using the National 2000 Geodetic Coordinate System, ensuring consistency with other national datasets and enabling seamless interoperability across domains [Data: Relationships (335)].

The DOM is generated from aerial imagery captured by intelligent photogrammetry systems such as FENYMA VI0 and D20, which conduct airborne surveys to collect raw image and point cloud data [Data: Relationships (52, 54, 62)]. These images are then orthorectified using DEMs to ensure spatial accuracy, enabling integration with other geospatial layers in GIS environments. The DOM serves as a foundational layer in geospatial database baseplates and supports 3D modeling when combined with elevation data [Data: Entities (51)]. Quality inspection processes ensure that the final DOM meets 1:2000 scale accuracy requirements, reinforcing its reliability for operational and scientific use [Data: Relationships (63)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Aerial triangulation as a foundational processing step\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Aerial triangulation is a critical photogrammetric technique used to determine the precise 3D positions of images and points, forming the mathematical backbone for both DEM and DOM generation. This process relies on overlapping aerial imagery captured during airborne surveys to compute exterior orientation parameters and establish spatial consistency across image blocks [Data: Entities (157); Relationships (167, 169)]. The output of aerial triangulation enables accurate reconstruction of terrain and surface features by providing the geometric framework needed for subsequent processing steps such as point cloud densification and orthorectification. It is a prerequisite for generating high-accuracy DEMs, as it ensures that elevation data is correctly georeferenced and aligned with the National 2000 Geodetic Coordinate System [Data: Relationships (167)]. The process is supported by standards such as the 低空数字航空摄影测量外业规范, which outlines technical requirements for low-altitude aerial operations [Data: Relationships (172)].

As the foundational coordinate system for China’s modern surveying infrastructure, it supports high-precision positioning and is essential for applications requiring accurate spatial referencing, such as infrastructure development, boundary delineation, and environmental monitoring. The reliance on this system ensures that both DEM and DOM products are not only internally consistent but also compatible with broader national and regional data infrastructures. Its adoption underscores the strategic standardization of geospatial workflows and reinforces the national importance of the datasets generated [Data: Entities (300); Relationships (335)].

The inspection process evaluates both vertical accuracy in DEMs and planimetric precision in DOMs, validating that distortions have been properly corrected and that data layers align with the National 2000 Geodetic Coordinate System. Given that these datasets support high-stakes applications such as flood modeling and urban development, any inaccuracies could lead to flawed analyses or unsafe designs. Therefore, quality control acts as a critical gatekeeping function in the production pipeline.
