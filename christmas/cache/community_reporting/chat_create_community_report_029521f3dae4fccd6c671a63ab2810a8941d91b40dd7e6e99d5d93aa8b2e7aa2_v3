It plays a pivotal role in flood prevention, administering seven of the 18 flood prevention targets in the Chonganjiang 001 watershed, which include historically recognized flash flood zones and newly identified high-risk areas. This high concentration of hazard zones underscores its importance in regional disaster risk management frameworks. Additionally, Xingshan Street is the site of the Xiniutan Reservoir construction project, a major infrastructure initiative aimed at supplying drinking water to urban populations, further highlighting its role in regional water security. The subdistrict's responsibilities span environmental monitoring, emergency preparedness, and coordination with county-level response systems, making it a linchpin in both developmental and protective governance efforts.

This geohazard poses a potential threat to nearby residents and infrastructure, particularly given its location along the riverbank where erosion and saturation during heavy rainfall could trigger slope failure. The identification of this landslide reflects ongoing efforts to update hazard maps and improve risk assessment accuracy in the Chonganjiang 001 watershed. As a newly recognized risk, it may not yet be fully integrated into emergency planning or mitigation strategies, increasing its potential impact. The discovery also highlights the dynamic nature of environmental risks in the region, where land use, hydrology, and topography interact to create evolving hazards. This finding underscores the need for continuous monitoring and community-level preparedness in vulnerable zones.

These structures were surveyed as part of a broader flash flood hazard assessment to evaluate their vulnerability to extreme weather events. Bridges and culverts, in particular, are critical for transportation but can become chokepoints during floods if debris accumulates or water levels exceed design capacity. Similarly, the presence of dams and reservoirs introduces both benefits—such as water storage and supply—and risks, including structural failure or downstream flooding. The coexistence of these engineered systems with natural hazards like channel narrowing and landslides increases the complexity of risk management in the area. The integration of these features into the flood risk assessment indicates a systematic approach to understanding cumulative vulnerabilities in the watershed.

This classification indicates a long-standing vulnerability that has likely been documented in previous hazard assessments and emergency planning documents. The continued recognition of this area as high-risk suggests that either the underlying conditions—such as proximity to the river, topography, or inadequate protective infrastructure—have not been sufficiently mitigated. The presence of a significant resident population in a known hazard zone raises concerns about community safety, emergency evacuation capacity, and long-term resilience planning. This situation also highlights the challenges of balancing rural habitation with environmental risk, particularly in regions where relocation may not be economically or socially feasible. Ongoing monitoring and public awareness initiatives are likely necessary to reduce potential loss of life during flood events.

This survey served as the primary source for identifying both the newly recognized riverside landslide in Lujiqiao Group and the historical landslide site in Gudong Town, demonstrating its role in validating and expanding existing hazard databases. The survey’s findings directly informed the risk profiles of both Xingshan Street and Gudong Town, enabling more accurate prioritization of mitigation efforts. Its structured methodology—covering multiple types of infrastructure and natural hazards—reflects a comprehensive approach to flood risk assessment in small watersheds, which are often disproportionately affected by flash floods due to rapid runoff and limited monitoring. By providing empirical data on hazard locations and types, the survey enhances the capacity for targeted interventions, early warning systems, and land-use planning.

Such encroachments are particularly dangerous during heavy rainfall events, as they can lead to upstream flooding, increased water velocity, and structural damage to nearby developments. The presence of this activity suggests potential gaps in land-use regulation or enforcement within the subdistrict, especially in areas already classified as high-risk. Given that floodplains are naturally designed to absorb excess water, their occupation undermines both ecological resilience and engineered flood control measures. This issue may also reflect broader socio-economic pressures, where communities expand into hazardous zones due to land scarcity or lack of alternatives. Addressing this risk likely requires a combination of regulatory enforcement, public education, and possibly relocation or buyout programs for at-risk properties.

In terms of infrastructure, Gudong Town has 3 surveyed reservoirs compared to 1 in Xingshan Street, yet both areas have multiple culverts, bridges, and ponds. Despite having fewer total hazard instances, Xingshan Street is more densely linked to the overall network due to its administrative role and the presence of the Xiniutan Reservoir project, which increases its systemic importance. The concentration of five of the seven high-risk zones in Xingshan Street’s Guyang Village further elevates its risk profile. This comparison underscores that while Gudong Town has more chronic, historically documented issues, Xingshan Street faces a combination of acute emerging hazards and high-stakes infrastructure developments, making it a focal point for integrated risk management.
