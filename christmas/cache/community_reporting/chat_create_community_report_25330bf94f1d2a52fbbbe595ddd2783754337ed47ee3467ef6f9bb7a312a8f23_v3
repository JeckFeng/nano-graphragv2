It has developed and is implementing the 'Guizhou Province 2025 Flash Flood Disaster Prevention Project Implementation Plan', which outlines a systematic approach to enhancing monitoring, early warning, and emergency response capabilities across high-risk watersheds [Data: Entities (12), Relationships (48)]. The province integrates national regulations such as the Reservoir Dam Safety Management Regulation and the River Channel Management Regulation into local practice, ensuring legal compliance while adapting to regional hydrological challenges [Data: Relationships (17, 18, 19, 20, 21)]. Furthermore, Guizhou is responsible for producing key technical tools such as the 'Guizhou Rainstorm and Flood Calculation Practical Handbook', which standardizes flood modeling methods across small watersheds [Data: Entities (39), Relationships (49)]. Its role extends to adopting and applying national technical standards like SL 767-2018 and supplementary trial guidelines for risk隐患 investigation, thereby aligning local efforts with national best practices [Data: Relationships (45, 47)].

Each small watershed, such as the Chong'an River 001 Small Watershed, functions as an integrated platform for hydrological modeling, hazard prediction, and emergency planning [Data: Entities (15), Relationships (16)]. These units are defined based on topography, hydrology, and administrative boundaries to ensure both hydrological independence and governance feasibility [Data: Entities (15)]. Within each small watershed, a network of monitoring stations collects real-time rainfall and water level data, which feeds into flood calculation models using methods such as the Manning equation [Data: Entities (24), Relationships (25), Entities (64)]. The small watershed also serves as the primary unit for administrative coordination, encompassing townships, administrative villages, natural villages, and enterprises, all of which are cataloged for risk assessment and evacuation planning [Data: Relationships (26, 27, 28, 29)]. This multi-layered integration makes the small watershed not only a technical but also a socio-political unit of disaster resilience, bridging scientific modeling with on-the-ground emergency response.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Integration of national legal and policy frameworks\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The flood risk management system in Guizhou is deeply embedded within a hierarchy of national laws and regulations, ensuring legal compliance and institutional legitimacy. Key national instruments such as the Reservoir Dam Safety Management Regulation (2018 revision), the River Channel Management Regulation, the Water Law (2016 revision), and the Flood Control Law (2016 revision) provide the foundational legal basis for dam safety, river management, water resource allocation, and flood control within small watersheds [Data: Entities (20, 19, 16, 17), Relationships (17, 18, 19, 20)]. These regulations mandate technical standards, safety inspections, emergency preparedness, and accountability mechanisms that are operationalized at the provincial and local levels. Additionally, the State Council has issued overarching emergency response and disaster assessment frameworks, including the National Overall Emergency Response Plan (Guo Fa [2025] No. 8) and the Interim Measures for Natural Disaster Investigation and Assessment (Guo Ban Fa [2025] No. 28), which guide post-disaster analysis and policy improvement [Data: Entities (21, 22), Relationships (34, 36)].

The 'Si Yu' (Four Pre-) system—encompassing forecasting, early warning, prevention, and response—is a key emergency management platform that relies on hydrological models developed specifically for small watersheds [Data: Entities (23), Relationships (32)]. These models use inputs such as rainfall data from monitoring stations and channel cross-section measurements to simulate flood behavior and predict inundation zones. Flood calculations are conducted using standardized methods such as the Manning formula, based on design storms and river cross-section data, enabling the estimation of water levels for different return periods [Data: Entities (64)]. The technical foundation is further strengthened by national standards such as SL 767-2018, which prescribes detailed procedures for flash flood investigation and evaluation, and complementary trial guidelines focusing on risk隐患 and impact analysis [Data: Entities (246, 245), Relationships (247)]. These technical tools are integrated into the Guizhou 2025 Implementation Plan, ensuring that data collection—via remote sensing, LiDAR, UAV photogrammetry, and field surveys—is standardized and contributes to accurate risk modeling [Data: Entities (12)].

Monitoring stations are strategically located within watersheds to capture real-time hydrological data, forming the backbone of the early warning system [Data: Entities (24), Relationships (25)]. At the administrative level, the system includes townships, administrative villages, and natural villages, all of which are mapped as part of the governance and emergency planning unit registry [Data: Relationships (26, 27, 28)]. Enterprises and public institutions located in flood-prone areas are also cataloged, reflecting a comprehensive approach to risk assessment that includes economic and social assets [Data: Relationships (29)]. This multi-scalar integration ensures that both biophysical processes and human systems are accounted for in risk modeling and emergency response planning, enhancing the resilience of the entire community.

These trial documents focus specifically on identifying hidden risk隐患 and analyzing their potential impacts, filling gaps in traditional survey methods. Their use in Guizhou’s 2025 implementation plan indicates a commitment to refining risk evaluation methodologies based on emerging data and field experience [Data: Relationships (47)]. This iterative, evidence-based approach enables the province to respond to the complexities of karst topography and extreme rainfall patterns more effectively.
